What is a binary classifier?,"(""we are in the trajectory where we are going to obtain a Blog diagram of our first classifier binary classifier that is but before we do so I think it's worthwhile kind of thinking a bit about the two general Frameworks which are present in the design of this probabilistic models that will give us the functional form of this binary classifier so in general there are two Frameworks the first one both of these Frameworks involve the posterior probability but in a kind of a different way so the first framework is called discriminative and the second one is generate and the difference between the two is quite important and they are although they both effectively are modeling in a different way at the posterior let me call this posterior y of the class small letter K given X which as we have seen in the probability review section this is the x given YK * P of YK and divided by P ofx so this is the posterior and these two Frameworks as we will see kind of model it a bit differently\n"", ['00:00:03.840', '00:01:45.159'])",2025-04-26 21:06:32.663306
