00:00:00.599 in
00:00:00.760 this
00:00:00.960 Example
00:00:01.439 The
00:00:01.960 Notebook
00:00:03.120 is
00:00:03.480 quite
00:00:04.960 instructive
00:00:05.799 because
00:00:06.600 it
00:00:06.879 refers
00:00:07.240 to
00:00:07.399 a
00:00:07.560 small
00:00:08.000 data
00:00:08.240 set
00:00:09.480 and
00:00:09.599 I
00:00:09.719 think
00:00:10.360 working
00:00:10.719 with
00:00:10.880 small
00:00:11.200 data
00:00:11.480 sets
00:00:11.679 are
00:00:12.000 actually
00:00:12.320 handy
00:00:12.880 in
00:00:13.000 the
00:00:13.160 beginning
00:00:13.639 when
00:00:13.880 you
00:00:14.360 are
00:00:14.519 trying
00:00:14.759 to
00:00:15.200 understand
00:00:15.400 what
00:00:15.519 is
00:00:15.679 going
00:00:15.920 on
00:00:16.680 here
00:00:16.960 we
00:00:17.160 have
00:00:17.720 the
00:00:18.000 classic
00:00:18.760 case
00:00:19.119 of
00:00:19.600 dogs
00:00:20.000 versus
00:00:20.359 cats
00:00:21.199 we
00:00:21.320 have
00:00:21.519 also
00:00:21.800 the
00:00:21.960 simplest
00:00:22.439 possible
00:00:22.960 task
00:00:23.800 in
00:00:24.039 machine
00:00:24.359 learning
00:00:24.880 which
00:00:25.039 is
00:00:25.519 classification
00:00:26.400 image
00:00:26.760 classification
00:00:27.519 in
00:00:27.679 this
00:00:27.920 case
00:00:28.880 and
00:00:29.119 we
00:00:29.279 are
00:00:29.400 going
00:00:29.519 to
00:00:29.599 be
00:00:29.679 using
00:00:30.160 convolutional
00:00:30.880 layers
00:00:31.759 in
00:00:31.880 order
00:00:32.160 to
00:00:32.399 detect
00:00:33.239 no
00:00:33.719 sorry
00:00:33.960 to
00:00:34.120 detect
00:00:34.440 to
00:00:35.399 classify
00:00:36.640 the
00:00:38.239 presence
00:00:38.600 of
00:00:38.800 a
00:00:39.000 dog
00:00:39.280 or
00:00:39.440 a
00:00:39.640 cat
00:00:40.640 on
00:00:40.879 in
00:00:41.200 an
00:00:41.440 image
00:00:42.000 okay
00:00:42.200 or
00:00:42.440 cats
00:00:42.760 in
00:00:42.920 this
00:00:43.120 case
00:00:43.760 all
00:00:43.920 right
00:00:44.120 so
00:00:45.160 the
00:00:46.600 data
00:00:46.879 set
00:00:47.079 is
00:00:47.239 available
00:00:47.640 in
00:00:47.840 kagle
00:00:48.640 the
00:00:48.760 original
00:00:49.199 data
00:00:49.480 set
00:00:50.079 contained
00:00:50.680 25,000
00:00:51.600 images
00:00:52.039 but
00:00:52.199 we
00:00:52.320 have
00:00:52.559 cut
00:00:52.879 down
00:00:54.039 to
00:00:54.320 1,000
00:00:55.120 images
00:00:56.039 per
00:00:56.680 class
00:00:57.680 and
00:00:58.559 we
00:00:58.879 have
00:00:59.160 a
00:00:59.320 split
00:01:00.000 the
00:01:00.120 data
00:01:00.399 set
00:01:01.120 into
00:01:02.079 train
00:01:02.480 and
00:01:02.800 validation
00:01:03.559 and
00:01:03.760 test
00:01:04.159 data
00:01:04.479 set
00:01:05.239 okay
00:01:05.880 all
00:01:06.080 right
00:01:06.320 so
00:01:07.119 we
00:01:07.240 are
00:01:07.439 going
00:01:07.680 to
00:01:08.720 obviously
00:01:09.159 use
00:01:09.479 train
00:01:09.799 and
00:01:10.000 validation
00:01:10.640 to
00:01:10.840 create
00:01:11.159 if
00:01:11.280 you
00:01:11.400 like
00:01:11.600 our
00:01:12.000 model
00:01:13.000 and
00:01:13.159 of
00:01:13.320 course
00:01:13.520 we
00:01:13.640 are
00:01:13.799 going
00:01:14.000 to
00:01:14.360 exercise
00:01:14.920 some
00:01:15.200 kind
00:01:15.360 of
00:01:16.000 prediction
00:01:17.000 API
00:01:18.080 using
00:01:18.400 our
00:01:18.640 test
00:01:18.920 data
00:01:19.240 set
00:01:19.560 after
00:01:19.840 a
00:01:19.960 model
00:01:20.320 is
00:01:20.520 created
00:01:21.479 so
00:01:21.720 the
00:01:21.920 architecture
00:01:22.479 we're
00:01:22.680 going
00:01:22.759 to
00:01:22.880 be
00:01:23.040 using
00:01:23.439 here
00:01:23.799 is
00:01:24.799 an

00:01:37.079 and
00:01:37.520 probably
00:01:37.880 you
00:01:38.040 recognize
00:01:39.159 the

00:01:39.920 here
00:01:40.159 in
00:01:40.320 this
00:01:40.759 case
00:01:41.079 is
00:01:41.280 a

00:03:21.560 I
00:03:21.640 think
00:03:21.799 it's

00:03:41.760 why
00:03:42.040 we

00:03:56.519 use
00:03:56.879 case
00:03:57.159 here
00:03:58.560 this
00:03:58.680 is
00:03:59.959 a
00:04:00.200 thousand
00:04:00.680 classes
00:04:01.200 that

00:04:06.920 Network
00:04:07.920 and
00:04:08.360 this
00:04:08.480 is
00:04:08.680 basically
00:04:09.040 the

00:04:13.439 we're
00:04:13.599 going
00:04:13.720 to
00:04:13.959 have
00:04:14.439 the
00:04:14.640 a
00:04:14.840 y
00:04:15.159 hat
00:04:15.360 if
00:04:15.480 you
00:04:15.640 like
00:04:16.440 that
00:04:16.680 consist
00:04:17.079 of
00:04:17.239 a
00:04:17.400 thousand
00:04:18.040 numbers
00:04:19.199 a
00:04:19.320 thousand
00:04:20.040 are
00:04:20.239 also
00:04:20.519 the
00:04:21.120 are
00:04:21.280 the

00:04:22.720 net
00:04:23.000 data
00:04:23.320 set
00:04:23.560 so
00:04:23.919 this
00:04:25.280 Dimensions
00:04:26.280 correspond
00:04:26.800 to

00:04:27.520 net
00:04:28.639 classifier
00:04:30.199 data
00:04:30.520 set
00:04:31.240 and
00:04:31.440 so
00:04:31.880 that's
00:04:32.120 basically
00:04:32.520 our
00:04:32.880 head
00:04:33.759 there
00:04:34.600 is
00:04:35.680 also
00:04:35.919 seen
00:04:36.280 over
00:04:36.520 here
00:04:36.720 in
00:04:36.880 this
00:04:37.160 code
00:04:38.160 with
00:04:38.840 this
00:04:39.199 portion
00:04:39.600 of
00:04:39.759 the
00:04:39.880 model
00:04:40.680 so
00:04:40.960 we
00:04:41.240 have
00:04:41.600 whatever
00:04:42.039 we
00:04:42.520 have
00:04:42.800 produced
00:04:43.759 in

00:04:45.160 over
00:04:45.440 here
00:04:45.840 and
00:04:45.960 then
00:04:46.120 we
00:04:46.320 flatten
00:04:46.960 the
00:04:47.360 network
00:04:48.360 so
00:04:48.600 we
00:04:48.800 flatten
00:04:49.600 oh
00:04:49.759 sorry
00:04:50.080 flatten
00:04:50.560 the

00:04:51.280 feature
00:04:51.600 map
00:04:52.000 there
00:04:52.639 by

00:04:53.680 F
00:04:53.960 map
00:04:54.160 we
00:04:54.240 are
00:04:54.360 creating
00:04:54.919 effectively
00:04:56.199 a
00:04:56.360 volume
00:04:56.720 we're
00:04:56.880 taking
00:04:57.120 a
00:04:57.280 volume
00:04:57.560 at
00:04:57.720 the
00:04:57.840 input
00:04:58.160 and
00:04:58.280 we're
00:04:58.440 flattening
00:04:58.960 into
00:04:59.199 a
00:04:59.400 vector
00:05:00.360 VOR
00:05:01.360 and
00:05:02.240 this
00:05:02.520 Vector
00:05:03.039 then
00:05:03.639 is
00:05:03.919 passed
00:05:04.320 as
00:05:05.960 to
00:05:06.960 two

00:05:12.639 neurons
00:05:13.560 it
00:05:13.720 takes
00:05:14.120 whatever
00:05:14.639 dimensionality
00:05:15.840 and
00:05:15.960 we'll
00:05:16.120 see
00:05:16.280 now
00:05:16.440 the
00:05:16.560 dimensions
00:05:16.960 in
00:05:17.080 a

00:05:18.800 layer
00:05:19.199 provided
00:05:19.800 and
00:05:20.039 reduces
00:05:20.840 that
00:05:21.600 just
00:05:21.800 like
00:05:22.039 any
00:05:22.240 fully
00:05:22.560 connected
00:05:23.000 layer
00:05:23.280 we
00:05:23.400 have

00:05:27.800 into
00:05:28.240 512
00:05:30.319 and
00:05:30.479 we
00:05:30.639 use
00:05:31.039 the

00:05:31.720 linear
00:05:32.120 unit
00:05:32.440 for

00:05:33.639 and
00:05:33.840 then
00:05:34.319 with
00:05:34.639 the
00:05:34.800 subsequent

00:05:36.319 512
00:05:37.280 dimensions
00:05:38.039 and
00:05:38.319 reduces
00:05:38.880 it
00:05:39.120 further
00:05:40.000 into

00:05:46.759 use
00:05:47.080 case
00:05:47.400 here
00:05:48.039 either
00:05:48.280 we're
00:05:48.440 going
00:05:48.520 to

00:05:50.600 we
00:05:50.840 have
00:05:53.000 just
00:05:53.199 a

00:05:53.800 that
00:05:53.919 we
00:05:54.039 need
00:05:54.479 because
00:05:54.840 that

00:06:07.919 we
00:06:08.039 are
00:06:08.160 actually

00:06:18.720 all
00:06:18.880 right
00:06:19.039 so
00:06:19.240 this

00:06:34.960 details
00:06:35.960 of
00:06:38.639 our
00:06:39.759 CNN
00:06:40.720 so
00:06:40.919 we
00:06:41.039 can
00:06:41.360 see
00:06:42.560 the

00:07:12.520 but
00:07:13.479 the

00:09:08.760 well
00:09:09.200 here
00:09:09.560 the
00:09:09.760 author
00:09:10.120 selected
00:09:10.720 the

00:09:14.640 one
00:09:14.800 of
00:09:14.959 the

00:09:17.680 we

00:09:18.120 really
00:09:18.399 got

00:09:22.839 but
00:09:23.000 if
00:09:23.079 you
00:09:23.200 do
00:09:23.480 replace
00:09:23.800 it
00:09:23.959 with

00:09:25.320 I
00:09:25.440 think
00:09:25.600 you
00:09:25.680 will
00:09:25.839 be
00:09:26.000 getting
00:09:26.360 very
00:09:26.600 similar

00:09:30.240 parameter
00:09:31.240 and
00:09:31.360 then
00:09:31.560 of
00:09:31.680 course
00:09:31.920 the
00:09:32.079 metric
00:09:32.480 is
00:09:32.640 our
00:09:33.360 accuracy
00:09:34.360 and
00:09:34.680 one
00:09:34.839 of
00:09:34.959 the
00:09:35.079 things
00:09:35.279 that
00:09:35.440 we
00:09:35.560 would
00:09:35.760 like
00:09:35.959 to
00:09:36.519 point
00:09:36.839 out
00:09:37.079 in
00:09:37.480 U
00:09:37.920 in
00:09:38.120 this

00:09:38.519 of
00:09:39.000 convolution
00:09:39.480 and
00:09:39.680 networks
00:09:40.160 is
00:09:40.320 that
00:09:40.880 we
00:09:41.000 will
00:09:41.200 need
00:09:41.360 to
00:09:41.560 do
00:09:42.240 to
00:09:42.360 be
00:09:42.560 careful
00:09:43.000 when
00:09:43.200 we
00:09:43.760 first
00:09:44.200 take
00:09:44.399 a
00:09:44.600 data
00:09:44.880 set
00:09:45.079 and
00:09:45.200 we
00:09:45.399 try
00:09:45.640 to
00:09:46.480 process
00:09:46.959 the

00:09:48.120 as
00:09:48.360 we
00:09:48.600 have
00:09:48.760 seen
00:09:49.480 the
00:09:49.640 images
00:09:50.120 are
00:09:50.480 typically
00:09:50.920 given

00:09:54.279 numbers
00:09:54.640 so
00:09:54.800 we
00:09:55.000 have
00:09:55.160 to
00:09:56.040 definitely
00:09:56.480 normalize

00:10:43.240 the

00:11:07.720 that
00:11:07.880 is
00:11:08.079 really
00:11:08.639 what
00:11:08.800 we
00:11:08.920 have
00:11:09.079 said
00:11:09.440 earlier
00:11:10.000 as
00:11:10.200 an
00:11:10.680 a
00:11:10.920 good
00:11:11.480 indicator
00:11:12.480 of
00:11:12.880 overfitting
00:11:13.880 okay
00:11:14.120 so
00:11:15.120 it
00:11:15.279 seems
00:11:15.519 that
00:11:15.760 the
00:11:16.959 Network
00:11:17.440 that
00:11:17.600 we
00:11:17.720 have
00:11:17.880 designed
00:11:18.279 over
00:11:18.560 here
00:11:18.839 overfits
00:11:19.480 the
00:11:19.639 data
00:11:19.920 set
00:11:20.120 we
00:11:20.200 are
00:11:20.360 given
00:11:20.680 and
00:11:21.040 it
00:11:21.120 shouldn't
00:11:21.519 be
00:11:21.720 a
00:11:21.920 complete
00:11:22.279 surprise
00:11:22.760 to
00:11:22.959 us
00:11:23.760 given
00:11:24.120 the
00:11:24.279 fact
00:11:24.480 that
00:11:24.600 we
00:11:24.720 are
00:11:24.880 throwing
00:11:25.519 a
00:11:25.880 significant
00:11:26.440 number
00:11:26.680 of
00:11:27.399 parameters
00:11:28.600 in
00:11:30.600 a
00:11:31.240 network
00:11:31.760 in
00:11:31.880 a
00:11:32.040 data
00:11:32.279 set
00:11:32.519 which
00:11:32.720 only
00:11:33.040 has
00:11:33.920 a
00:11:34.079 th000
00:11:34.399 labels
00:11:34.839 per
00:11:35.120 class
00:11:36.120 and
00:11:36.279 so
00:11:37.160 we
00:11:37.360 can
00:11:37.519 actually
00:11:37.839 engage
00:11:38.440 any
00:11:38.680 of
00:11:38.839 the
00:11:39.079 techniques
00:11:39.480 that
00:11:39.639 we
00:11:39.800 have
00:11:39.920 seen
00:11:40.360 in
00:11:41.120 overfitting
00:11:42.240 to
00:11:42.440 address
00:11:42.760 overfitting
00:11:43.440 such
00:11:43.639 as
00:11:43.839 weight
00:11:44.120 Decay
00:11:44.959 any
00:11:45.160 of
00:11:45.360 the
00:11:45.480 regularization
00:11:46.240 techniques
00:11:47.160 that
00:11:47.320 we
00:11:47.440 have
00:11:47.560 seen
00:11:47.760 also
00:11:47.920 in
00:11:48.040 neuron
00:11:48.360 networks
00:11:48.800 to
00:11:49.240 address
00:11:49.560 it
00:11:49.800 but
00:11:49.920 in
00:11:50.120 computer
00:11:50.519 vision
00:11:50.880 we
00:11:51.040 have
00:11:51.320 something
00:11:52.200 else
00:11:52.600 that
00:11:52.760 could
00:11:53.000 actually
00:11:53.399 help
00:11:53.720 us
00:11:54.040 and
00:11:54.240 this
00:11:54.440 is
00:11:54.720 actually
00:11:55.360 called
00:11:55.720 the
00:11:56.279 documentation
00:11:57.279 so
00:11:57.440 I
00:11:57.560 think
00:11:57.680 it's
00:11:57.920 worthwhile
00:11:58.560 going
00:11:58.920 through
00:12:00.440 the
00:12:01.360 data
00:12:01.639 augmentation
00:12:02.240 because
00:12:02.480 it
00:12:02.600 is
00:12:03.200 really
00:12:03.480 a
00:12:03.680 fairly
00:12:04.120 straightforward
00:12:05.040 and
00:12:05.320 widely
00:12:05.760 used
00:12:06.240 approach
00:12:06.760 to
00:12:07.079 avoid
00:12:07.519 the
00:12:07.720 situation
00:12:08.279 such
00:12:08.480 as
00:12:08.680 this
00:12:08.959 where
00:12:09.120 we
00:12:09.279 have
00:12:09.480 overfeeding
00:12:10.399 so
00:12:10.560 in
00:12:10.680 that
00:12:10.920 augmentation
00:12:11.639 what
00:12:11.800 we
00:12:12.000 actually
00:12:12.279 do
00:12:13.040 we
00:12:13.240 are
00:12:13.560 taking
00:12:13.920 the
00:12:14.120 input
00:12:14.519 images
00:12:15.480 and
00:12:15.639 given
00:12:15.920 the
00:12:16.079 fact
00:12:16.240 that
00:12:16.399 we
00:12:16.600 have
00:12:16.920 the
00:12:17.199 knowledge
00:12:17.600 of
00:12:17.720 the
00:12:17.920 class
00:12:18.279 we
00:12:18.519 try
00:12:18.800 to
00:12:19.040 transform
00:12:19.639 these
00:12:19.839 input
00:12:20.240 images
00:12:20.680 in
00:12:20.959 creating
00:12:21.480 more
00:12:21.839 data
00:12:22.680 so
00:12:22.920 that's
00:12:23.240 the
00:12:23.360 an
00:12:23.519 artificial
00:12:24.160 way
00:12:24.320 of
00:12:24.480 increasing
00:12:25.000 the
00:12:25.120 number
00:12:25.360 of
00:12:25.560 labels
00:12:26.000 we
00:12:26.120 have
00:12:26.279 in
00:12:26.399 our
00:12:26.680 data
00:12:26.959 set
00:12:27.839 we
00:12:28.440 have
00:12:28.680 various
00:12:29.000 kind
00:12:29.240 of
00:12:29.360 Transformations
00:12:30.199 we
00:12:30.320 may
00:12:30.519 be
00:12:31.120 shifting
00:12:31.839 rotating
00:12:32.360 images
00:12:32.920 we
00:12:33.079 may
00:12:34.680 sharing
00:12:36.160 the
00:12:36.399 image
00:12:37.279 we
00:12:37.440 have
00:12:37.639 we
00:12:37.760 are
00:12:37.920 zooming
00:12:38.320 in
00:12:38.639 zooming
00:12:39.040 out
00:12:40.240 and
00:12:40.839 flipping
00:12:41.639 and
00:12:41.839 so
00:12:42.040 on
00:12:42.680 we
00:12:42.839 are
00:12:43.160 definitely
00:12:43.519 going
00:12:43.680 to
00:12:43.839 be
00:12:44.040 creating
00:12:44.639 some
00:12:46.160 nasty
00:12:47.959 cats
00:12:49.399 or
00:12:49.639 dogs
00:12:50.600 but
00:12:50.880 definitely
00:12:51.320 this
00:12:51.519 helps
00:12:52.000 our
00:12:52.399 Network
00:12:53.000 to
00:12:53.360 not
00:12:53.800 overfit
00:12:54.800 and
00:12:54.959 so
00:12:55.240 if
00:12:55.399 you
00:12:55.680 are
00:12:55.959 to
00:12:56.680 just
00:12:56.959 keep
00:12:57.279 the
00:12:57.519 exactly
00:12:58.000 the
00:12:58.160 same
00:12:58.600 network
00:12:59.160 chitecture
00:12:59.680 as
00:12:59.839 we
00:12:59.959 have
00:13:00.120 seen
00:13:00.480 earlier
00:13:01.440 not
00:13:02.000 touch
00:13:02.240 at
00:13:02.399 all
00:13:02.600 the
00:13:02.760 model
00:13:03.519 but
00:13:03.920 definitely
00:13:04.399 train
00:13:04.800 the
00:13:04.920 model
00:13:05.399 with
00:13:05.680 this
00:13:06.000 additional
00:13:06.639 kind
00:13:06.839 of
00:13:07.440 data
00:13:07.800 set
00:13:08.880 then
00:13:11.079 look
00:13:11.360 what
00:13:11.560 happened
00:13:12.399 we
00:13:12.600 have
00:13:13.320 a
00:13:13.519 training
00:13:13.920 and
00:13:14.160 validation
00:13:14.800 loss
00:13:15.480 which
00:13:15.680 are
00:13:16.320 very
00:13:16.600 close
00:13:16.880 to
00:13:17.079 each
00:13:17.240 other
00:13:17.720 so
00:13:17.920 we
00:13:18.199 actually
00:13:18.519 have
00:13:18.720 solved
00:13:19.680 the
00:13:20.160 overfeeding
00:13:20.959 problem
00:13:21.600 and
00:13:21.880 our
00:13:22.480 accuracy
00:13:23.480 is
00:13:24.120 both
00:13:24.440 in
00:13:24.560 terms
00:13:24.839 of
00:13:25.000 training
00:13:25.360 and
00:13:25.560 validation
00:13:26.320 are
00:13:26.519 also
00:13:26.880 very
00:13:27.160 close
00:13:28.120 and
00:13:28.519 close
00:13:28.760 to
00:13:28.920 some
00:13:29.120 something
00:13:29.360 like
00:13:29.959 85%
00:13:30.959 okay
00:13:31.120 so
00:13:31.240 I
00:13:31.360 think
00:13:31.519 this
00:13:31.639 is
00:13:31.720 a
00:13:31.920 good
00:13:32.199 example
00:13:33.040 to
00:13:33.240 showcase
00:13:34.000 the
00:13:34.360 U
00:13:35.600 CNN
00:13:36.720 models
00:13:37.920 as
00:13:38.160 a
00:13:38.519 as
00:13:38.680 working
00:13:39.120 for
00:13:39.480 the
00:13:39.680 simple
00:13:40.040 task
00:13:40.320 of
00:13:40.519 image
00:13:41.160 classification
00:13:42.160 and
00:13:42.360 what
00:13:42.560 we
00:13:42.839 actually
00:13:43.240 also
00:13:43.560 would
00:13:43.760 like
00:13:44.000 to
00:13:44.959 understand
00:13:45.279 now
00:13:45.560 next
00:13:46.079 is
00:13:47.079 what
00:13:47.240 we
00:13:47.399 have
00:13:47.560 said
00:13:47.839 earlier
00:13:48.320 about
00:13:49.160 Hey
00:13:49.519 what
00:13:50.399 how
00:13:50.600 can
00:13:50.720 we
00:13:50.959 have
00:13:51.160 some
00:13:51.440 kind
00:13:51.600 of
00:13:52.240 visualization
00:13:53.240 into
00:13:53.920 the
00:13:54.160 internals
00:13:54.720 of
00:13:54.920 the
00:13:55.040 CNN
00:13:55.519 to
00:13:56.040 understand
00:13:56.360 what
00:13:56.519 is
00:13:57.399 what
00:13:57.560 is
00:13:57.759 actually
00:13:58.040 learning
00:13:58.880 and
00:13:59.240 this
00:13:59.360 is
00:13:59.519 what
00:13:59.680 we
00:13:59.800 will
00:14:00.199 be
00:14:00.399 discussing
00:14:01.000 next
