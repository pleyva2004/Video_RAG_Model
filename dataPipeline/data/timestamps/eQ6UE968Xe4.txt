00:00:00.960 we
00:00:01.079 have
00:00:01.199 seen
00:00:01.919 earlier
00:00:02.919 the
00:00:03.360 regression
00:00:03.919 problem
00:00:04.960 where
00:00:05.160 we
00:00:05.359 have
00:00:05.960 effectively
00:00:06.399 to
00:00:06.560 model
00:00:06.879 a
00:00:07.160 conditional
00:00:07.439 probability
00:00:08.120 distribution
00:00:09.120 at
00:00:09.280 the
00:00:09.400 output
00:00:09.760 of
00:00:09.880 our
00:00:10.120 predictor
00:00:10.960 now
00:00:11.120 we
00:00:11.360 actually
00:00:11.599 switching
00:00:12.000 to
00:00:12.200 a
00:00:12.360 new
00:00:12.639 task
00:00:13.360 it's
00:00:13.480 a
00:00:13.679 classification
00:00:14.440 task
00:00:15.040 where
00:00:15.280 again
00:00:15.559 we
00:00:15.679 will
00:00:16.199 solve
00:00:16.560 this
00:00:16.720 task
00:00:17.000 using
00:00:17.240 The
00:00:17.359 Vaping
00:00:17.760 block
00:00:18.039 diagram
00:00:18.920 again
00:00:19.240 we
00:00:19.359 will
00:00:19.560 need
00:00:19.760 to
00:00:19.920 model
00:00:20.400 our
00:00:20.760 predictor
00:00:21.199 with
00:00:21.320 a
00:00:21.640 conditional
00:00:21.920 probability
00:00:22.480 distribution
00:00:23.480 but
00:00:23.640 in
00:00:23.800 classification
00:00:24.760 our
00:00:25.000 Target
00:00:25.359 variables
00:00:25.800 are
00:00:26.039 distinct
00:00:27.039 and
00:00:27.279 discrete
00:00:27.880 random
00:00:28.279 variables
00:00:28.760 rather
00:00:29.080 than
00:00:30.000 continues
00:00:30.840 so
00:00:31.519 in
00:00:31.920 this
00:00:32.079 kind
00:00:32.239 of
00:00:32.399 setting
00:00:32.680 I'll
00:00:32.880 motivate
00:00:33.440 the
00:00:34.280 classification
00:00:35.440 task
00:00:35.920 with
00:00:36.280 a
00:00:36.559 simple
00:00:36.879 use
00:00:37.239 case
00:00:37.680 is
00:00:38.120 actually
00:00:38.399 going
00:00:38.520 to
00:00:38.600 be
00:00:38.719 called
00:00:38.920 the
00:00:39.040 radar
00:00:39.640 problem
00:00:40.640 and
00:00:41.399 we'll
00:00:41.840 that's
00:00:42.039 what
00:00:42.160 we
00:00:42.280 will
00:00:42.640 start
00:00:43.000 with
00:00:44.719 next
00:00:45.719 in
00:00:45.879 this
00:00:46.360 setting
00:00:47.199 the
00:00:47.320 use
00:00:47.719 case
00:00:47.960 the
00:00:48.120 application
00:00:48.680 we
00:00:48.760 will
00:00:49.320 see
00:00:50.559 is
00:00:51.120 a
00:00:51.239 well-known
00:00:51.719 application
00:00:52.480 back
00:00:52.719 in
00:00:52.920 the

00:01:01.239 was
00:01:01.440 W
00:01:02.280 primarily
00:01:03.280 from
00:01:04.600 the

00:01:05.199 of
00:01:05.439 these
00:01:06.600 towers
00:01:07.759 this
00:01:08.119 was
00:01:08.400 actually
00:01:08.680 called
00:01:08.960 the
00:01:09.080 radar
00:01:10.240 Towers
00:01:11.400 whose
00:01:11.880 job
00:01:12.200 is
00:01:12.439 was
00:01:12.600 to

00:01:36.159 it
00:01:36.320 was
00:01:36.520 returning
00:01:37.119 back
00:01:37.920 into
00:01:38.240 what
00:01:38.399 we

00:01:38.960 the
00:01:39.159 radar
00:01:42.680 receiver
00:01:43.680 and
00:01:44.240 there
00:01:44.399 was
00:01:44.920 kind
00:01:45.079 of

00:02:04.240 antenna
00:02:05.240 it
00:02:05.439 was
00:02:06.039 he
00:02:06.240 was
00:02:07.680 calling
00:02:08.119 London
00:02:09.119 and
00:02:09.520 millions
00:02:09.959 of
00:02:10.399 people
00:02:10.840 were
00:02:11.440 well
00:02:11.599 the
00:02:11.680 sirens
00:02:12.080 were
00:02:12.200 sounding
00:02:12.560 and
00:02:12.680 millions
00:02:13.000 of
00:02:13.120 people
00:02:13.280 were
00:02:13.480 actually
00:02:13.879 running
00:02:15.000 to
00:02:15.200 the

00:02:17.599 to
00:02:19.360 save
00:02:19.680 their
00:02:19.879 lives
00:02:20.480 that
00:02:20.640 was
00:02:20.879 the
00:02:21.560 application
00:02:22.560 and
00:02:24.120 this
00:02:24.319 application
00:02:24.840 is
00:02:25.239 evidently
00:02:25.760 present
00:02:26.120 in
00:02:26.319 any
00:02:27.080 modern
00:02:27.519 car
00:02:27.840 today
00:02:28.319 that
00:02:28.640 has
00:02:29.400 exactly
00:02:29.720 the
00:02:30.080 same
00:02:30.800 ability
00:02:31.400 to
00:02:32.720 have
00:02:32.879 Raiders
00:02:33.760 located
00:02:34.200 in
00:02:34.400 the
00:02:35.120 let's
00:02:35.319 say
00:02:35.480 in
00:02:35.560 the
00:02:35.720 front
00:02:36.879 of
00:02:37.040 the
00:02:37.200 car
00:02:37.959 to
00:02:38.120 send
00:02:38.440 exactly
00:02:38.800 the
00:02:38.920 same
00:02:39.120 signals
00:02:40.000 and
00:02:40.239 every
00:02:40.519 time
00:02:40.840 that
00:02:41.000 you
00:02:41.720 have
00:02:41.840 a
00:02:42.000 feature
00:02:42.280 in
00:02:42.440 your
00:02:42.599 car
00:02:43.000 that
00:02:43.840 it's
00:02:44.400 automatic
00:02:46.120 what
00:02:46.239 is
00:02:46.440 called
00:02:47.120 automatic
00:02:48.120 distance
00:02:49.159 keeping
00:02:50.319 to
00:02:50.480 the
00:02:50.640 vehicle
00:02:50.959 in
00:02:51.080 front
00:02:51.319 of
00:02:51.440 you
00:02:51.720 that
00:02:51.840 is
00:02:52.120 exactly
00:02:52.519 the
00:02:52.680 same
00:02:52.959 thing
00:02:53.680 it
00:02:53.920 was
00:02:54.159 returning
00:02:54.720 back
00:02:55.000 that
00:02:55.200 Reflection
00:02:55.720 from
00:02:55.920 the
00:02:56.159 car
00:02:56.360 in
00:02:56.640 front
00:02:57.640 and
00:02:58.239 controller
00:02:58.760 is
00:02:58.920 actually
00:02:59.159 trying
00:02:59.400 to
00:02:59.519 keep
00:02:59.720 the
00:03:00.400 velocities
00:03:01.400 between
00:03:01.760 your
00:03:02.040 car
00:03:02.400 and
00:03:02.560 the
00:03:02.720 car
00:03:02.879 in
00:03:03.000 front
00:03:03.239 of
00:03:03.360 you
00:03:03.599 constant
00:03:04.040 and
00:03:04.200 therefore
00:03:04.519 maintain
00:03:04.959 a
00:03:05.200 desired
00:03:05.640 distance
00:03:06.040 between
00:03:06.360 the
00:03:06.480 two
00:03:06.680 cars
00:03:07.560 but
00:03:07.799 anyway
00:03:08.120 I
00:03:08.200 would
00:03:08.560 motivate
00:03:09.040 it
00:03:09.280 with
00:03:09.480 this
00:03:10.239 sort
00:03:10.480 of
00:03:11.760 application
00:03:12.480 which
00:03:12.640 is
00:03:12.879 the
00:03:14.000 World
00:03:14.280 War
00:03:14.519 II
00:03:15.319 application
00:03:16.319 because
00:03:16.680 also
00:03:17.080 back
00:03:17.360 then
00:03:18.000 a
00:03:18.120 lot
00:03:18.280 of
00:03:18.440 the
00:03:18.599 terminology
00:03:19.239 that
00:03:19.400 we
00:03:19.519 will
00:03:19.920 cover
00:03:20.280 today
00:03:21.159 it
00:03:21.360 was
00:03:21.640 also
00:03:22.720 first
00:03:23.720 invented
00:03:25.000 and
00:03:25.480 just
00:03:25.599 to
00:03:25.799 see
00:03:26.080 exactly
00:03:26.480 what
00:03:26.599 is
00:03:26.760 actually
00:03:27.080 happening
00:03:27.560 here
00:03:27.879 we
00:03:28.080 have
00:03:28.400 a
00:03:28.799 some
00:03:29.080 kind
00:03:29.239 of
00:03:29.360 a
00:03:29.519 time
00:03:30.760 plot
00:03:31.239 of
00:03:31.439 a
00:03:31.599 quantity
00:03:32.040 that
00:03:32.200 will
00:03:32.400 be
00:03:32.519 calling
00:03:32.959 X
00:03:33.879 and
00:03:34.040 it
00:03:34.159 will
00:03:34.400 be
00:03:34.840 designating
00:03:35.480 for
00:03:35.680 us
00:03:35.959 the
00:03:40.760 strength
00:03:41.760 of
00:03:42.200 or
00:03:42.720 received
00:03:42.920 signal
00:03:43.239 strength
00:03:43.560 or
00:03:43.959 power
00:03:44.959 and
00:03:45.319 very
00:03:45.480 simplistically
00:03:46.239 we
00:03:46.400 have
00:03:46.920 some
00:03:47.920 you
00:03:48.040 know
00:03:48.319 some
00:03:49.159 fluctuation
00:03:50.159 received
00:03:50.480 power
00:03:51.239 when
00:03:51.480 we
00:03:51.720 have
00:03:52.319 a
00:03:52.599 return
00:03:52.799 a
00:03:53.040 strong
00:03:53.319 return
00:03:53.519 from
00:03:54.120 a
00:03:54.439 plane
00:03:55.439 and
00:03:55.799 in
00:03:56.280 nights
00:03:56.720 where
00:03:56.879 we
00:03:57.040 don't
00:03:57.599 the
00:03:57.760 attacks
00:03:58.040 were
00:03:58.200 usually
00:03:58.799 during
00:03:59.040 the
00:03:59.200 night
00:04:00.480 that
00:04:00.920 when
00:04:01.079 we
00:04:01.280 have
00:04:01.439 no
00:04:01.840 return
00:04:02.159 we
00:04:02.280 still
00:04:02.599 have
00:04:03.000 some
00:04:03.239 fluctuating
00:04:03.879 signal
00:04:04.319 power
00:04:04.680 much
00:04:04.840 smaller
00:04:05.280 than
00:04:06.680 that
00:04:08.159 and
00:04:09.040 okay
00:04:09.519 our
00:04:11.879 receiver
00:04:13.079 is
00:04:13.640 going
00:04:13.920 to
00:04:14.439 have
00:04:14.879 just
00:04:15.159 one
00:04:16.040 knob
00:04:17.040 that
00:04:17.239 knob
00:04:17.639 is
00:04:17.840 going
00:04:18.040 to
00:04:18.160 be
00:04:18.359 called
00:04:19.000 the
00:04:19.239 threshold
00:04:20.239 will
00:04:20.519 symbolize
00:04:21.040 it
00:04:21.199 with
00:04:21.440 W
00:04:22.280 it's
00:04:22.440 a
00:04:22.600 scalar
00:04:23.240 value
00:04:24.240 that
00:04:24.440 it
00:04:24.600 is
00:04:26.000 anything
00:04:26.600 that
00:04:26.919 exceeds
00:04:27.800 it
00:04:28.800 is
00:04:29.080 going
00:04:29.360 to
00:04:33.240 let's
00:04:33.440 assume
00:04:33.720 that
00:04:33.880 this
00:04:34.080 threshold
00:04:34.759 value
00:04:35.039 is
00:04:35.199 set
00:04:35.600 to
00:04:35.800 this
00:04:35.960 kind
00:04:36.120 of
00:04:36.280 level
00:04:36.639 everything
00:04:36.960 that
00:04:37.199 exceeds
00:04:37.520 it
00:04:37.759 is
00:04:37.960 going
00:04:38.160 to
00:04:38.400 be
00:04:39.199 called
00:04:40.639 predicted
00:04:41.840 that
00:04:42.039 is
00:04:43.280 well
00:04:43.440 not
00:04:43.680 predicted
00:04:44.120 is
00:04:44.479 we're
00:04:44.680 going
00:04:44.800 to
00:04:44.919 sound
00:04:45.199 the
00:04:45.320 alarm
00:04:46.039 and
00:04:46.199 anything
00:04:46.600 that
00:04:46.759 it
00:04:46.919 is
00:04:47.400 not
00:04:47.639 exceeding
00:04:48.080 it
00:04:48.960 we
00:04:49.080 are
00:04:49.280 going
00:04:49.560 to
00:04:49.919 not
00:04:51.400 alarm
00:04:52.440 anyone
00:04:53.440 alert
00:04:53.919 anyone
00:04:54.440 and
00:04:55.160 we
00:04:56.120 will
00:04:57.520 call
00:04:57.880 that
00:04:58.840 the
00:04:59.039 no
00:04:59.280 attack
00:04:59.840 case
00:05:00.479 so
00:05:00.759 our
00:05:01.320 problem
00:05:02.320 is
00:05:03.280 a
00:05:03.479 binary
00:05:03.880 classification
00:05:04.639 problem
00:05:05.120 what
00:05:05.240 we
00:05:05.400 call
00:05:05.639 binary
00:05:06.120 because
00:05:06.400 our
00:05:06.720 now
00:05:07.000 Target
00:05:07.360 variable
00:05:07.759 as
00:05:07.919 compared
00:05:08.240 to
00:05:08.360 that
00:05:08.759 regression
00:05:09.600 can
00:05:09.759 only
00:05:10.039 take
00:05:10.280 two
00:05:10.560 values
00:05:11.120 one
00:05:12.039 we
00:05:12.160 will
00:05:12.400 call
00:05:12.720 this
00:05:12.960 the
00:05:13.120 so-called
00:05:13.960 positive
00:05:14.960 condition
00:05:15.479 the
00:05:15.880 attack
00:05:16.160 is
00:05:16.320 going
00:05:16.560 on
00:05:17.400 and
00:05:17.680 zero
00:05:18.600 we
00:05:18.720 will
00:05:18.960 be
00:05:19.160 calling
00:05:19.639 this
00:05:19.880 the
00:05:20.319 So-Cal
00:05:22.600 negative
00:05:24.400 condition
00:05:25.400 and
00:05:26.520 our
00:05:27.280 job
00:05:28.120 here
00:05:29.240 now
00:05:29.440 that
00:05:29.759 we
00:05:29.840 are
00:05:30.000 in
00:05:31.400 the
00:05:32.880 2020s
00:05:33.880 we
00:05:34.000 are
00:05:34.240 going
00:05:34.840 to
00:05:35.840 solve
00:05:36.400 this
00:05:36.680 problem
00:05:37.479 of
00:05:38.160 determining
00:05:39.160 the
00:05:39.960 value
00:05:40.360 of
00:05:40.560 that
00:05:40.759 kind
00:05:40.919 of
00:05:41.080 threshold
00:05:42.039 using
00:05:42.520 kind
00:05:42.680 of
00:05:43.440 machine
00:05:43.759 learning
00:05:44.160 approaches
00:05:44.880 so
00:05:45.160 we
00:05:45.360 have
00:05:46.319 what
00:05:46.479 we
00:05:46.600 will
00:05:46.800 do
00:05:47.479 is
00:05:47.680 we
00:05:47.800 will
00:05:48.080 task
00:05:48.560 a
00:05:49.479 military
00:05:50.000 person
00:05:50.400 over
00:05:50.680 here
00:05:50.880 to
00:05:51.520 sit
00:05:52.520 and
00:05:52.840 observe
00:05:53.759 what
00:05:53.919 is
00:05:54.240 really
00:05:55.240 happening
00:05:55.840 every
00:05:56.319 single
00:05:56.759 day
00:05:57.400 so
00:05:58.199 first
00:05:58.759 night
00:05:59.639 records
00:05:59.919 the
00:06:00.199 signal
00:06:00.600 strength
00:06:01.160 X1
00:06:02.160 and
00:06:02.440 Records
00:06:02.960 also
00:06:03.280 whether
00:06:03.600 attack
00:06:03.919 has
00:06:04.120 happened
00:06:04.479 or
00:06:04.639 not
00:06:05.400 X2
00:06:06.080 the
00:06:06.240 same
00:06:06.560 way
00:06:07.720 and
00:06:07.880 so
00:06:08.440 on
00:06:09.440 if
00:06:09.599 they
00:06:09.800 survive
00:06:10.440 we
00:06:10.560 will
00:06:11.360 keep
00:06:11.639 them
00:06:11.960 if
00:06:12.160 they
00:06:12.319 not
00:06:12.560 we
00:06:12.720 have
00:06:12.840 to
00:06:13.000 replace
00:06:13.319 them
00:06:13.520 with
00:06:13.639 somebody
00:06:14.440 else
00:06:15.720 so
00:06:17.120 XM
00:06:18.479 ym
00:06:19.479 that's
00:06:19.720 our
00:06:20.479 let's
00:06:20.720 say
00:06:21.639 we
00:06:21.800 have
00:06:22.000 aggregated
00:06:22.599 M
00:06:23.080 examples
00:06:23.880 of
00:06:25.599 what
00:06:25.800 is
00:06:26.240 has
00:06:26.680 happened
00:06:27.680 at
00:06:27.840 our
00:06:28.280 receiver
00:06:29.160 and
00:06:29.720 as
00:06:30.319 before
00:06:30.560 we
00:06:30.800 progress
00:06:31.199 into
00:06:32.280 specifying
00:06:33.280 what
00:06:33.400 is
00:06:33.919 really
00:06:34.240 the
00:06:34.960 problem
00:06:35.319 statement
00:06:35.800 I
00:06:35.960 just
00:06:36.120 want
00:06:36.360 to
00:06:37.360 U
00:06:37.759 convey
00:06:38.160 some
00:06:38.360 kind
00:06:38.560 of
00:06:38.680 an
00:06:38.840 intuitive
00:06:39.840 fashion
00:06:40.360 of
00:06:40.680 what
00:06:40.800 is
00:06:41.000 happening
00:06:41.319 so
00:06:41.560 this
00:06:41.800 was
00:06:42.479 the
00:06:42.680 soal
00:06:43.560 attack
00:06:44.560 signal
00:06:44.960 strength
00:06:45.400 and
00:06:45.639 this
00:06:45.880 was
00:06:46.160 the
00:06:46.960 no
00:06:49.520 attack
00:06:50.840 signal
00:06:51.240 strength
00:06:52.160 the
00:06:52.639 sort
00:06:52.880 of
00:06:53.400 time
00:06:53.720 series
00:06:54.080 of
00:06:54.240 all
00:06:54.440 these
00:06:54.599 kind
00:06:54.759 of
00:06:54.960 observations
00:06:55.639 night
00:06:55.879 after
00:06:56.479 night
00:06:57.479 and
00:06:57.800 we
00:06:58.000 have
00:07:01.319 the
00:07:01.440 problem
00:07:01.720 to
00:07:01.840 solve
00:07:02.120 is
00:07:02.240 to
00:07:02.360 come
00:07:02.520 up
00:07:02.680 with
00:07:02.800 an
00:07:03.000 optimal
00:07:03.440 value
00:07:03.759 for
00:07:04.160 the
00:07:04.319 threshold
00:07:05.160 you
00:07:05.280 can
00:07:05.680 understand
00:07:05.800 that
00:07:05.919 the
00:07:06.000 threshold
00:07:06.440 is
00:07:06.639 quite
00:07:06.919 critical
00:07:07.840 in
00:07:08.120 determining
00:07:08.840 whether
00:07:09.879 how
00:07:10.080 the
00:07:10.240 system
00:07:10.960 operates
00:07:12.080 if
00:07:12.199 we
00:07:12.319 set
00:07:12.560 the
00:07:12.720 threshold
00:07:13.440 too
00:07:14.120 high
00:07:15.400 this
00:07:15.639 means
00:07:15.919 that
00:07:16.120 we
00:07:16.280 will
00:07:16.759 be
00:07:19.160 missing
00:07:19.800 quite
00:07:20.039 a
00:07:20.160 lot
00:07:20.400 of
00:07:21.000 attacks
00:07:22.000 and
00:07:22.400 evidently
00:07:22.960 people
00:07:23.240 will
00:07:23.879 die
00:07:24.879 if
00:07:25.080 we
00:07:25.599 set
00:07:25.919 the
00:07:26.080 threshold
00:07:26.759 too
00:07:27.360 low
00:07:28.639 this
00:07:28.759 means
00:07:29.039 that
00:07:29.240 we
00:07:29.560 will
00:07:29.759 be
00:07:32.360 waking
00:07:32.800 up
00:07:33.759 everyone
00:07:35.919 unnecessarily
00:07:37.120 the
00:07:38.000 first
00:07:38.319 night
00:07:38.680 they
00:07:38.879 will
00:07:39.879 believe
00:07:40.280 us
00:07:40.639 and
00:07:41.639 you
00:07:41.800 know
00:07:42.520 return
00:07:42.720 to
00:07:42.919 their
00:07:43.120 beds
00:07:44.840 disappointed
00:07:45.840 somehow
00:07:46.400 or
00:07:46.960 relieved
00:07:48.080 the
00:07:48.199 second
00:07:48.560 night
00:07:48.800 they
00:07:48.919 will
00:07:49.199 still
00:07:49.440 believe
00:07:49.800 us
00:07:50.000 they
00:07:50.120 will
00:07:50.280 go
00:07:50.479 down
00:07:50.639 to
00:07:50.800 the
00:07:51.000 tube
00:07:51.840 but
00:07:52.000 after
00:07:52.319 the
00:07:52.479 third
00:07:52.800 night
00:07:53.199 they
00:07:53.319 will
00:07:53.639 stop
00:07:54.199 believing
00:07:54.639 us
00:07:54.879 and
00:07:55.000 when
00:07:55.120 a
00:07:55.280 real
00:07:55.560 ATT
00:07:56.159 happens
00:07:57.360 people
00:07:57.639 will
00:07:58.240 also
00:07:58.599 die
00:07:59.120 so
00:08:00.520 the
00:08:00.639 system
00:08:00.919 will
00:08:01.120 lose
00:08:01.440 complete
00:08:02.039 credibility
00:08:02.840 so
00:08:03.080 the
00:08:03.280 choice
00:08:03.560 of
00:08:03.759 this
00:08:04.159 W
00:08:05.159 is
00:08:06.400 quite
00:08:06.720 critical
00:08:07.199 so
00:08:07.599 our
00:08:08.680 predictor
00:08:09.680 the
00:08:09.879 Y
00:08:10.159 hat
00:08:10.360 that
00:08:10.520 we
00:08:10.639 have
00:08:10.800 to
00:08:11.000 predict
00:08:11.759 at
00:08:11.960 this
00:08:12.120 moment
00:08:12.400 in
00:08:12.599 time
00:08:12.800 we
00:08:12.919 will
00:08:13.520 treat
00:08:13.919 this
00:08:14.240 as
00:08:14.560 a
00:08:15.560 one
00:08:15.759 and
00:08:16.000 zero
00:08:16.400 later
00:08:16.800 will
00:08:17.039 become
00:08:18.199 a
00:08:18.360 number
00:08:18.759 between
00:08:19.120 zero
00:08:19.400 and
00:08:19.599 one
00:08:20.520 is
00:08:20.800 also
00:08:21.159 going
00:08:26.000 to
00:08:27.000 return
00:08:28.199 our
00:08:28.479 prediction
00:08:28.919 predictor
00:08:29.240 is
00:08:29.319 going
00:08:29.639 also
00:08:29.800 to
00:08:30.120 return
00:08:31.120 one
00:08:31.440 or
00:08:31.720 zero
00:08:32.080 for
00:08:32.320 the
00:08:32.560 positive
00:08:32.959 and
00:08:34.479 negative
00:08:35.479 condition
00:08:36.240 respectively
00:08:37.240 okay
00:08:37.640 so
00:08:37.919 that
00:08:38.120 is
00:08:39.279 the
00:08:39.479 problem
00:08:39.839 statement
00:08:40.440 how
00:08:41.200 to
00:08:41.440 set
00:08:41.680 up
00:08:42.000 this
00:08:42.440 W
00:08:43.839 optimally
00:08:45.240 and
00:08:45.519 as
00:08:45.640 you
00:08:45.760 can
00:08:46.200 understand
00:08:46.959 I
00:08:47.160 can
00:08:49.600 just
00:08:50.240 after
00:08:51.160 just
00:08:51.320 before
00:08:51.600 in
00:08:51.760 the
00:08:51.880 regression
00:08:52.320 kind
00:08:52.480 of
00:08:52.680 problem
00:08:53.600 we
00:08:53.800 had
00:08:54.720 introduced
00:08:55.839 the
00:08:56.040 probabilistic
00:08:56.800 nature
00:08:57.279 of
00:08:57.640 every
00:08:58.079 predictor
00:08:59.079 so
00:08:59.279 what
00:08:59.600 we
00:08:59.680 will
00:09:00.800 now
00:09:01.800 is
00:09:03.160 we
00:09:10.519 draw
00:09:11.519 two
00:09:11.800 probability
00:09:13.360 distributions
00:09:14.360 and
00:09:15.000 let
00:09:15.160 me
00:09:15.399 just
00:09:15.560 draw
00:09:15.880 this
00:09:16.079 probability
00:09:16.640 distribution
00:09:17.360 let's
00:09:17.600 say
00:09:22.399 this
00:09:23.399 so
00:09:23.600 this
00:09:23.720 is
00:09:23.800 a
00:09:24.000 probability
00:09:24.440 distribution
00:09:25.040 of
00:09:25.760 X
00:09:26.760 we
00:09:26.920 have
00:09:27.160 here
00:09:27.279 on
00:09:27.440 the
00:09:27.600 x-
00:09:27.800 axis
00:09:28.120 our
00:09:28.360 signal
00:09:28.720 strength
00:09:30.440 and
00:09:31.079 one
00:09:31.279 of
00:09:31.480 them
00:09:31.800 is
00:09:32.000 going
00:09:32.200 to
00:09:32.360 be
00:09:32.640 called
00:09:33.640 the
00:09:33.880 probability
00:09:34.560 of
00:09:35.839 X
00:09:36.839 and
00:09:38.120 when
00:09:39.120 no
00:09:39.399 attack
00:09:39.720 is
00:09:40.040 happening
00:09:41.040 and
00:09:41.240 this
00:09:41.360 is
00:09:41.519 the
00:09:41.720 probability
00:09:42.560 of
00:09:42.959 X
00:09:43.959 when
00:09:44.240 the
00:09:44.440 attack
00:09:44.760 is
00:09:45.240 happening
00:09:46.240 and
00:09:46.920 as
00:09:47.040 you
00:09:47.160 can
00:09:47.360 see
00:09:47.920 these
00:09:48.040 two
00:09:48.240 prob
00:09:48.560 distributions
00:09:49.160 can
00:09:49.279 be
00:09:49.519 easily
00:09:49.920 obtained
00:09:50.880 U
00:09:51.160 as
00:09:51.720 histograms
00:09:52.720 by
00:09:52.959 just
00:09:53.600 going
00:09:54.000 back
00:09:54.240 to
00:09:55.040 our
00:09:56.600 data
00:09:56.959 tape
00:09:57.839 the

00:09:58.279 set
00:09:58.480 that
00:09:58.600 we
00:09:58.720 have
00:09:58.920 created
00:10:00.240 and
00:10:00.800 recorded
00:10:01.800 and
00:10:02.600 select

00:10:05.440 is
00:10:05.880 zero
00:10:06.880 and
00:10:07.079 obtain
00:10:07.519 this

00:10:08.480 and
00:10:08.839 visit
00:10:09.200 all
00:10:09.399 the

00:10:17.399 definitely
00:10:18.040 a

00:10:19.399 I
00:10:19.480 will

00:10:22.600 and
00:10:22.720 as
00:10:22.839 you
00:10:23.079 probably
00:10:23.399 notice

00:10:33.079 that
00:10:33.279 they
00:10:33.399 are

00:12:17.360 interest
00:12:17.720 to
00:12:18.120 me
00:12:19.120 so
00:12:19.320 I
00:12:19.440 want
00:12:19.600 to
00:12:20.240 shade
00:12:21.240 the
00:12:21.399 first
00:12:21.760 probability
00:12:23.360 tail
00:12:24.360 which
00:12:24.519 is
00:12:24.760 this
00:12:26.800 one
00:12:27.800 I
00:12:27.920 want
00:12:28.160 also
00:12:28.360 to
00:12:28.519 shade
00:12:28.920 this
00:12:32.639 and
00:12:33.000 area
00:12:33.600 and
00:12:33.920 also
00:12:34.279 want
00:12:34.440 to
00:12:34.680 say
00:12:35.000 with
00:12:35.240 horizontal
00:12:36.399 stripes
00:12:37.399 this
00:12:39.680 area
00:12:40.680 so
00:12:40.959 these
00:12:41.160 three
00:12:41.440 areas
00:12:41.839 are
00:12:42.000 I
00:12:42.120 think
00:12:42.279 will
00:12:42.480 be
00:12:43.040 quite
00:12:43.600 important
00:12:46.120 now
00:12:47.120 the
00:12:47.279 overlap
00:12:47.880 means
00:12:48.360 that
00:12:48.760 since
00:12:49.000 there's
00:12:49.199 no
00:12:49.480 absolutely
00:12:50.199 clear
00:12:51.639 separation
00:12:52.279 between
00:12:52.600 the
00:12:52.720 two
00:12:53.160 prob
00:12:54.120 distributions
00:12:55.360 we
00:12:55.480 are
00:12:55.720 always
00:12:56.000 going
00:12:56.199 to
00:12:56.360 make
00:12:56.560 some
00:12:56.800 form
00:12:57.079 of
00:12:57.320 mistake
00:12:57.880 we
00:12:58.079 always
00:12:58.320 going
00:12:58.480 to
00:12:58.600 have
00:12:58.760 mistakes
00:12:59.639 and
00:12:59.800 in
00:13:00.000 fact
00:13:00.639 we
00:13:00.800 can
00:13:01.199 clearly
00:13:02.040 distinguish
00:13:03.519 four
00:13:11.760 conditions
00:13:12.959 and
00:13:13.160 we
00:13:13.279 will
00:13:13.480 tabulate
00:13:14.040 them
00:13:14.320 with
00:13:14.760 what
00:13:14.920 we
00:13:15.160 call
00:13:15.480 the
00:13:15.720 confusion
00:13:16.839 Matrix
00:13:17.959 on
00:13:18.199 the
00:13:18.600 one
00:13:18.920 axis
00:13:19.199 of
00:13:19.360 the
00:13:19.519 confusion
00:13:20.000 Matrix
00:13:20.399 we'll
00:13:20.639 be
00:13:20.839 assigning
00:13:21.360 this
00:13:21.600 axis
00:13:22.000 to
00:13:23.000 the
00:13:23.199 so-call
00:13:23.880 ground
00:13:24.199 truth
00:13:25.040 and
00:13:25.240 the
00:13:25.399 other
00:13:25.800 to
00:13:26.160 the
00:13:26.600 prediction
00:13:27.600 the
00:13:27.800 yut
00:13:29.440 and
00:13:29.959 when
00:13:30.199 the
00:13:30.639 Y
00:13:31.000 hat
00:13:31.920 is
00:13:32.920 positive
00:13:33.279 and
00:13:33.800 negative
00:13:34.800 and
00:13:35.040 this
00:13:35.639 positive
00:13:36.040 and
00:13:36.240 negative
00:13:36.959 agrees
00:13:37.959 to
00:13:38.360 the
00:13:38.920 with
00:13:39.079 the
00:13:39.240 ground
00:13:39.560 truth
00:13:40.320 then
00:13:40.560 we
00:13:40.720 will
00:13:41.320 be
00:13:41.519 calling
00:13:41.920 this
00:13:42.199 correspondingly
00:13:42.920 true
00:13:43.279 positive
00:13:44.199 and
00:13:44.399 true
00:13:46.959 negative
00:13:48.079 in
00:13:48.240 fact
00:13:48.399 it's
00:13:48.600 actually
00:13:48.959 quite
00:13:49.399 common
00:13:49.680 to
00:13:49.800 write
00:13:50.040 first
00:13:50.279 the
00:13:50.440 letter
00:13:50.839 the
00:13:51.000 second
00:13:51.320 letter
00:13:51.600 as
00:13:51.759 a
00:13:52.440 pneumonic
00:13:53.560 rule
00:13:54.519 write
00:13:54.759 first
00:13:55.000 the
00:13:55.199 second
00:13:55.480 letter
00:13:55.800 and
00:13:56.000 put
00:13:56.160 a
00:13:56.560 word
00:13:57.240 the
00:13:57.399 letter
00:13:57.639 T
00:13:57.920 in
00:13:58.040 front
00:13:58.480 every
00:13:58.720 time
00:13:58.880 the
00:13:59.120 that
00:13:59.279 you
00:13:59.880 have
00:14:00.160 agreement
00:14:00.600 with
00:14:00.800 ground
00:14:01.399 truth
00:14:02.399 in
00:14:02.639 the
00:14:03.399 case
00:14:03.680 where
00:14:03.880 you
00:14:04.040 predict
00:14:04.440 there
00:14:04.600 is
00:14:04.720 an
00:14:04.920 attack
00:14:05.320 going
00:14:05.560 on
00:14:06.000 but
00:14:06.199 you
00:14:06.399 are
00:14:07.199 wrong
00:14:08.440 you
00:14:08.680 are
00:14:08.959 prepending
00:14:09.560 it
00:14:09.800 with
00:14:10.040 the
00:14:11.720 letter
00:14:12.079 F
00:14:12.399 stands
00:14:12.639 for
00:14:12.839 false
00:14:13.199 so
00:14:13.360 we
00:14:13.480 have
00:14:13.680 false
00:14:14.040 positive
00:14:14.519 here
00:14:15.320 and
00:14:15.519 here
00:14:15.759 we
00:14:15.920 have
00:14:16.160 also
00:14:16.440 false
00:14:16.839 negative
00:14:17.320 we
00:14:17.440 are
00:14:18.079 predicting
00:14:18.680 negative
00:14:19.240 but
00:14:19.399 we
00:14:19.519 are
00:14:19.880 wrong
00:14:20.880 and
00:14:21.079 therefore
00:14:21.560 we
00:14:21.759 have
00:14:22.360 the
00:14:22.519 so-called
00:14:22.959 false
00:14:23.279 negative
00:14:23.800 events
00:14:24.800 the
00:14:25.839 overlap
00:14:26.839 as
00:14:27.079 compared
00:14:27.440 to
00:14:27.600 the
00:14:27.839 case
00:14:28.240 which
00:14:28.440 is
00:14:29.600 quite
00:14:29.880 unrealistic
00:14:30.560 in
00:14:30.759 practice
00:14:31.240 where
00:14:31.440 we
00:14:31.639 have
00:14:32.360 some
00:14:32.639 form
00:14:32.920 of
00:14:33.560 significant
00:14:34.199 separation
00:14:35.000 between
00:14:36.240 the
00:14:36.759 two
00:14:37.079 histograms
00:14:37.920 like
00:14:38.279 this
00:14:39.040 and
00:14:39.320 this
00:14:40.000 and
00:14:40.160 therefore
00:14:40.480 it's
00:14:40.639 easy
00:14:40.880 to
00:14:41.040 select
00:14:41.519 something
00:14:42.440 of
00:14:42.600 a
00:14:42.759 threshold
00:14:43.279 W
00:14:43.680 that
00:14:43.800 will
00:14:44.000 separate
00:14:44.399 the
00:14:44.560 two
00:14:44.880 conditions
00:14:45.480 perfectly
00:14:46.480 the
00:14:46.639 So-Cal
00:14:47.040 linearly
00:14:47.680 separable
00:14:49.160 case
00:14:50.440 is
00:14:50.959 not
00:14:51.240 present
00:14:51.680 here
00:14:52.600 so
00:14:52.839 we
00:14:53.000 are
00:14:53.240 going
00:14:53.560 to
00:14:54.639 so
00:14:54.800 let
00:14:54.920 me
00:14:55.160 just
00:14:55.680 delete
00:14:56.040 it
00:14:57.079 to
00:14:57.279 avoid
00:14:57.600 any
00:14:57.839 confusion
00:14:58.440 is
00:14:58.600 not
00:14:58.800 present
00:14:59.279 here
00:14:59.440 so
00:14:59.560 we
00:14:59.720 always
00:14:59.959 going
00:15:00.120 to
00:15:00.399 have
00:15:01.320 in
00:15:01.480 other
00:15:01.759 words
00:15:03.759 these
00:15:04.000 two
00:15:05.160 type
00:15:05.399 of
00:15:05.560 events
00:15:06.000 present
00:15:06.880 in
00:15:07.120 our
00:15:08.199 problem
00:15:09.199 and
00:15:09.720 before
00:15:10.000 I
00:15:10.199 describe
00:15:10.639 what
00:15:10.800 was
00:15:11.000 actually
00:15:11.320 happening
00:15:11.720 every
00:15:11.959 time
00:15:12.160 we
00:15:12.360 get
00:15:13.079 this
00:15:13.320 threshold
00:15:13.880 W
00:15:14.360 to
00:15:14.600 not
00:15:14.800 be
00:15:15.120 set
00:15:15.880 optimally
00:15:16.880 when
00:15:17.079 the
00:15:17.440 threshold
00:15:17.959 W
00:15:18.800 is
00:15:18.959 Set
00:15:20.240 too
00:15:20.560 high
00:15:21.519 then
00:15:21.759 we
00:15:21.880 are
00:15:22.639 missing
00:15:24.000 the
00:15:25.079 events
00:15:26.120 that
00:15:26.240 are
00:15:26.759 actually
00:15:27.320 attacks
00:15:27.720 that
00:15:27.839 are
00:15:28.000 actually
00:15:28.240 going
00:15:29.240 will
00:15:29.839 happen
00:15:30.839 and
00:15:31.279 therefore
00:15:31.720 we
00:15:31.880 are
00:15:32.120 going
00:15:32.360 to
00:15:32.880 be
00:15:34.759 increasing
00:15:35.279 our
00:15:35.480 Force
00:15:35.839 negative
00:15:36.480 so
00:15:36.680 we
00:15:36.800 are
00:15:37.000 predicting
00:15:37.440 that
00:15:37.600 no
00:15:38.000 attacks
00:15:38.319 is
00:15:38.519 happening
00:15:38.959 while
00:15:39.160 in
00:15:39.319 fact
00:15:39.560 they
00:15:39.680 are
00:15:40.519 and
00:15:40.680 if
00:15:40.800 the
00:15:41.000 W
00:15:41.920 is
00:15:42.079 set
00:15:42.319 too
00:15:42.639 low
00:15:43.800 we
00:15:43.920 are
00:15:44.079 going
00:15:44.240 to
00:15:44.360 be
00:15:44.519 increasing
00:15:45.040 the
00:15:45.160 false
00:15:45.680 positive
00:15:46.880 rate
00:15:47.440 and
00:15:47.680 in
00:15:47.920 fact
00:15:48.160 we
00:15:48.319 will
00:15:48.800 be
00:15:50.440 alerting
00:15:52.199 sort
00:15:52.480 of
00:15:54.720 the
00:15:55.000 people
00:15:55.240 to
00:15:55.440 go
00:15:55.680 down
00:15:55.920 to
00:15:56.120 the
00:15:56.319 cube
00:15:56.880 but
00:15:57.639 unfortunately
00:15:58.639 no
00:15:59.079 attack
00:15:59.360 is
00:15:59.560 actually
00:16:19.560 on
00:16:20.560 now
00:16:20.759 that
00:16:20.880 we
00:16:21.000 have
00:16:21.199 recognized
00:16:21.639 that
00:16:21.759 we
00:16:21.920 always
00:16:22.160 going
00:16:22.279 to
00:16:22.440 make
00:16:22.839 mistake
00:16:23.839 as
00:16:24.079 manifested
00:16:24.720 by
00:16:24.920 this
00:16:26.319 confusion
00:16:27.319 Matrix
00:16:30.959 we
00:16:31.120 are
00:16:31.839 interested
00:16:32.319 to
00:16:32.519 just
00:16:32.800 qualify
00:16:33.440 these
00:16:33.680 mistakes
00:16:34.480 and
00:16:34.639 quantify
00:16:35.199 those
00:16:35.440 mistakes
00:16:35.959 by
00:16:36.199 just
00:16:37.120 understanding
00:16:38.399 the
00:16:39.560 probability
00:16:40.560 of
00:16:42.519 making
00:16:42.839 a
00:16:44.639 mistake
00:16:45.639 this
00:16:45.759 is
00:16:46.319 definitely
00:16:46.800 the
00:16:48.560 probability
00:16:49.560 of
00:16:50.560 when
00:16:50.759 we
00:16:50.959 make
00:16:52.160 where
00:16:52.759 our
00:16:53.040 prediction
00:16:53.600 why
00:16:53.920 hat
00:16:55.120 is
00:16:56.120 not
00:16:56.399 equal
00:16:56.720 to
00:16:56.839 the
00:16:57.000 ground
00:16:57.279 Ruth
00:16:57.639 y
00:16:59.440 and
00:16:59.720 this
00:16:59.880 is
00:17:00.199 happens
00:17:00.720 in
00:17:00.959 two
00:17:02.000 instances
00:17:03.000 the
00:17:03.240 first
00:17:03.919 instance
00:17:04.919 is
00:17:05.439 when
00:17:05.720 we
00:17:07.079 have
00:17:08.079 the
00:17:08.919 probability
00:17:09.919 when
00:17:10.120 we
00:17:10.280 make
00:17:10.600 the
00:17:11.880 prediction
00:17:12.360 that
00:17:12.520 no
00:17:12.760 attack
00:17:13.000 is
00:17:13.199 happening
00:17:14.120 when
00:17:14.360 in
00:17:14.559 fact
00:17:15.000 there
00:17:15.120 is
00:17:15.240 an
00:17:15.480 attack
00:17:17.559 plus
00:17:18.559 the
00:17:20.480 events
00:17:21.480 when
00:17:21.880 we
00:17:22.039 are
00:17:22.520 making
00:17:23.000 the
00:17:23.240 opposite
00:17:26.280 claim
00:17:27.280 and
00:17:27.880 I
00:17:27.959 think
00:17:28.120 it's
00:17:28.280 worthwhile
00:17:28.720 now
00:17:29.120 trying
00:17:29.360 to
00:17:30.120 understand
00:17:30.400 what
00:17:30.559 is
00:17:30.760 happening
00:17:31.120 in
00:17:31.360 this
00:17:31.880 what
00:17:32.000 are
00:17:32.200 those
00:17:32.400 probabilities
00:17:33.000 and
00:17:33.160 how
00:17:33.360 they
00:17:33.520 related
00:17:33.880 to
00:17:34.039 these
00:17:34.200 histan
00:17:34.799 we
00:17:34.919 have
00:17:35.440 plotted
00:17:36.440 the
00:17:36.559 moment
00:17:37.080 we
00:17:37.280 have
00:17:39.320 specified
00:17:39.919 the
00:17:40.080 threshold
00:17:40.760 location
00:17:41.160 over
00:17:41.440 here
00:17:42.320 w
00:17:43.320 we
00:17:43.480 have
00:17:43.679 split
00:17:44.039 the
00:17:44.160 region
00:17:44.480 into
00:17:44.720 two
00:17:45.039 parts
00:17:45.559 the
00:17:45.720 first
00:17:45.960 region
00:17:46.280 is
00:17:46.400 called
00:17:46.640 r0
00:17:47.240 and
00:17:47.360 the
00:17:47.520 second
00:17:47.799 region
00:17:48.120 is
00:17:48.240 called
00:17:50.799 R1
00:17:51.799 and
00:17:52.600 now
00:17:52.880 that
00:17:53.080 we
00:17:53.240 have
00:17:53.559 this
00:17:55.280 region
00:17:55.640 names
00:17:56.000 I
00:17:56.120 think
00:17:56.240 the
00:17:56.360 region
00:17:56.640 names
00:17:56.919 are
00:17:57.120 also
00:17:57.720 intuitively
00:17:59.440 kind
00:17:59.600 of
00:17:59.760 understood
00:18:00.360 because
00:18:00.720 this
00:18:00.960 zero
00:18:01.280 index
00:18:01.640 here
00:18:01.840 corresponds
00:18:02.320 to
00:18:02.440 the
00:18:02.600 case
00:18:02.840 where
00:18:03.000 we
00:18:03.480 declare
00:18:04.480 anything
00:18:04.840 as
00:18:05.000 we
00:18:05.120 said
00:18:05.360 below
00:18:05.760 the
00:18:06.200 threshold
00:18:06.720 W
00:18:07.120 is
00:18:07.440 there's
00:18:07.679 no
00:18:07.919 attack
00:18:08.919 we
00:18:09.000 are
00:18:09.200 predicting
00:18:09.600 no
00:18:09.799 attack
00:18:10.080 so
00:18:10.400 that's
00:18:10.600 the
00:18:10.760 what
00:18:10.880 the
00:18:11.000 zero
00:18:11.320 is
00:18:11.559 here
00:18:12.360 and
00:18:12.520 anything
00:18:12.960 above
00:18:13.320 the
00:18:13.480 w
00:18:14.000 we
00:18:14.159 have
00:18:14.919 we
00:18:15.200 predicting
00:18:15.720 attack
00:18:16.000 is
00:18:16.520 happening
00:18:17.520 and
00:18:17.679 that's
00:18:17.880 why
00:18:18.080 the
00:18:18.240 one
00:18:18.440 is
00:18:18.640 there
00:18:19.280 we
00:18:19.440 can
00:18:19.600 actually
00:18:20.120 start
00:18:21.520 putting
00:18:21.919 this
00:18:22.120 probabilities
00:18:22.799 quantifying
00:18:23.280 these
00:18:23.480 probabilities
00:18:24.080 based
00:18:24.400 on
00:18:24.760 the
00:18:25.360 area
00:18:26.520 under
00:18:27.480 the
00:18:27.760 those
00:18:28.440 cures
00:18:29.600 and
00:18:29.919 we
00:18:30.240 I
00:18:30.360 hope
00:18:30.520 you
00:18:30.640 all
00:18:30.840 remember
00:18:31.480 that
00:18:31.760 probability
00:18:32.320 for
00:18:32.840 continuous
00:18:33.679 random
00:18:34.440 variables
00:18:34.880 such
00:18:35.080 a

00:18:35.559 strength
00:18:35.919 over

00:18:40.880 so
00:18:41.159 what

00:18:41.440 going

00:18:41.919 now
00:18:42.120 is
00:18:42.240 I'm
00:18:42.400 going
00:18:42.600 to

00:18:46.520 probability
00:18:47.039 over

00:19:26.679 belong

00:19:42.000 equivalent

00:19:45.080 convention
00:19:45.559 that
00:19:45.760 I
00:19:45.960 had
00:19:46.799 about

00:19:51.640 so
00:19:51.880 this
00:19:52.080 one
00:19:53.120 the

00:20:01.880 corresponds

00:20:07.520 distribution
00:20:08.360 so
00:20:08.640 this
00:20:08.799 probability
00:20:09.240 distribution
00:20:09.840 but
00:20:10.039 only
00:20:10.280 the
00:20:10.440 left
00:20:10.720 tail
00:20:11.080 so
00:20:11.200 you
00:20:11.280 can
00:20:11.440 see
00:20:11.679 here
00:20:11.840 that
00:20:12.000 the
00:20:12.120 whole
00:20:12.360 probability
00:20:12.919 distribution
00:20:13.559 here
00:20:13.720 the

00:20:16.880 =

00:20:17.520 but
00:20:17.679 here
00:20:17.840 I'm
00:20:17.960 interesting
00:20:18.480 only
00:20:18.720 for
00:20:18.960 the

00:20:19.400 equal
00:20:19.640 to
00:20:19.799 r0
00:20:20.760 so
00:20:20.960 it's
00:20:21.120 the

00:20:21.679 of

00:20:25.080 over

00:20:25.600 so
00:20:25.880 I
00:20:26.000 am
00:20:26.200 going
00:20:26.440 to

00:20:35.720 DX
00:20:36.720 and
00:20:36.799 I'm
00:20:36.919 going
00:20:37.039 to
00:20:37.240 take
00:20:37.520 this
00:20:37.679 and
00:20:37.919 actually

00:21:04.400 over
00:21:04.720 here
00:21:05.440 I
00:21:05.520 can
00:21:06.000 understand

00:21:06.360 this

00:21:20.320 this

00:21:28.960 I'm
00:21:29.159 wrong
00:21:30.080 and

00:21:35.679 I'm
00:21:35.840 also
00:21:36.120 wrong

00:21:37.919 positive

00:21:55.240 and
00:21:55.679 I
00:21:55.840 just
00:21:56.000 want
00:21:56.200 you
00:21:56.360 to
00:21:56.840 understand
00:21:57.120 how

00:21:57.919 we

00:22:02.279 that

00:22:03.600 will

00:22:06.720 you

00:22:07.320 make
00:22:07.720 it
00:22:07.960 zero
00:22:08.360 because
00:22:08.919 as
00:22:09.039 we
00:22:09.240 discussed
00:22:09.640 we
00:22:09.760 do
00:22:09.919 not
00:22:10.440 face
00:22:10.799 in
00:22:10.960 this

00:22:13.279 linearly
00:22:13.799 separable
00:22:14.279 data
00:22:14.679 set
00:22:15.200 but
00:22:15.360 at
00:22:15.520 the
00:22:15.640 very
00:22:15.840 least
00:22:16.080 we
00:22:16.200 can
00:22:16.360 minimize
00:22:16.880 the

00:22:19.720 negative
00:22:20.880 events
00:22:21.880 and
00:22:22.799 imagine
00:22:23.279 that
00:22:23.799 you
00:22:23.960 are

00:22:27.480 side
00:22:27.720 over
00:22:27.960 here
00:22:28.120 so
00:22:28.600 trying

00:22:28.960 move
00:22:29.200 this

00:22:29.559 to
00:22:29.720 the

00:22:31.559 and
00:22:32.039 look
00:22:32.279 what's
00:22:32.559 happening
00:22:32.919 as
00:22:33.039 you're
00:22:33.240 moving
00:22:33.520 into

00:22:35.200 gradually
00:22:36.200 you
00:22:36.480 will
00:22:36.679 come
00:22:41.720 so
00:22:42.720 maybe
00:22:43.000 two
00:22:43.200 snapshots
00:22:43.760 are
00:22:44.000 enough

00:22:45.520 what

00:22:55.200 achieving
00:22:56.200 is
00:22:56.480 we

00:22:59.880 going
00:23:00.240 to
00:23:00.720 whatever

00:23:06.880 striped

00:23:07.760 we

00:23:10.880 area
00:23:11.880 having
00:23:12.200 said
00:23:12.480 that
00:23:12.679 we
00:23:12.880 actually
00:23:13.159 start
00:23:13.480 seeing
00:23:13.919 reduction
00:23:14.559 of

00:23:16.679 and
00:23:16.919 this
00:23:17.080 area
00:23:17.360 will
00:23:17.520 start
00:23:17.760 to
00:23:17.919 be
00:23:18.080 reduced
00:23:18.520 and
00:23:18.640 reduced
00:23:19.000 and
00:23:19.120 reduced
00:23:19.559 up
00:23:19.679 to
00:23:19.840 the
00:23:20.039 point
00:23:20.400 where
00:23:20.600 we
00:23:21.039 reach
00:23:22.039 what
00:23:22.200 will
00:23:22.480 be
00:23:23.400 calling
00:23:24.400 the
00:23:24.640 W
00:23:25.640 star
00:23:26.640 the
00:23:26.919 optimal
00:23:27.480 w
00:23:29.679 and
00:23:29.840 thus
00:23:30.039 optimal
00:23:30.480 W
00:23:30.840 is
00:23:30.960 the
00:23:31.159 W
00:23:31.559 that
00:23:31.760 minimized
00:23:32.679 this
00:23:32.880 probability
00:23:33.360 of
00:23:33.520 mistake
00:23:34.159 simply
00:23:34.760 because
00:23:35.760 in
00:23:36.080 that
00:23:36.600 location
00:23:37.320 the
00:23:37.440 bubbly
00:23:38.000 area
00:23:38.480 got
00:23:39.000 eliminated
00:23:40.480 completely
00:23:41.480 and
00:23:41.679 the

00:23:42.520 of
00:23:42.840 the
00:23:43.679 therefore
00:23:44.120 of
00:23:44.279 the

00:23:46.080 that
00:23:46.279 included
00:23:46.960 it
00:23:48.679 is
00:23:49.039 the
00:23:49.240 minimum
00:23:50.559 possible
00:23:51.559 so
00:23:52.279 actually
00:23:52.640 we
00:23:52.760 can
00:23:52.960 write
00:23:53.600 that
00:23:54.840 sort
00:23:55.080 of
00:23:55.360 optimizing
00:24:01.400 the

00:24:03.080 towards
00:24:03.559 W
00:24:05.720 star
00:24:06.919 will
00:24:07.200 be
00:24:13.279 using
00:24:14.279 the
00:24:18.200 well-known
00:24:19.200 to
00:24:19.520 us
00:24:20.520 stochastic
00:24:21.159 gr
00:24:21.559 descent
00:24:25.120 algorithm
00:24:26.120 that
00:24:32.200 minimizes
00:24:33.200 the
00:24:35.080 probability
00:24:36.279 of
00:24:39.760 mistakes
00:24:40.760 probability
00:24:41.200 of
00:24:41.360 making
00:24:41.600 a
00:24:41.760 mistake
00:24:42.360 so
00:24:42.559 the
00:24:42.720 misclassification
00:24:44.080 error
00:24:45.080 or
00:24:45.480 also
00:24:52.200 misclassification
00:24:53.200 error
00:24:53.600 eight
00:24:54.120 so
00:24:54.360 this
00:24:54.480 will
00:24:54.679 be
00:24:54.880 done
00:24:55.679 now
00:24:55.960 that
00:24:56.120 we
00:24:56.360 have

00:24:57.480 motivation
00:24:57.960 of
00:24:58.120 what
00:24:58.399 we're
00:24:58.559 trying
00:24:58.720 to
00:24:58.880 achieve
00:24:59.279 here
00:25:00.000 we
00:25:00.159 now
00:25:00.320 need
00:25:00.520 to
00:25:01.080 understand
00:25:01.559 how
00:25:01.720 we
00:25:01.880 can
00:25:02.559 also
00:25:02.880 motivate
00:25:04.080 in

00:25:06.440 function
00:25:07.440 and
00:25:07.720 that
00:25:07.880 it
00:25:08.000 is
00:25:08.120 going
00:25:08.240 to
00:25:08.360 be
00:25:08.480 suitable
00:25:09.320 for
00:25:10.520 our
00:25:11.679 problem
00:25:12.120 here
00:25:12.320 which
00:25:12.440 is
00:25:12.559 the
00:25:12.720 classification
00:25:13.480 problem
00:25:13.720 in
00:25:13.799 a
00:25:13.960 similar
00:25:14.320 way
00:25:14.520 as
00:25:14.679 we
00:25:14.840 have
00:25:15.000 done
00:25:15.960 with
00:25:16.240 the
00:25:16.640 U
00:25:17.120 earlier
00:25:17.559 loss
00:25:17.880 function
00:25:18.279 we
00:25:18.399 have
00:25:18.600 used
00:25:19.000 initially
00:25:19.720 was
00:25:19.960 called
00:25:20.200 mean
00:25:20.480 square
00:25:20.919 error
00:25:21.919 and
00:25:22.360 then
00:25:22.559 it
00:25:22.720 was
00:25:22.960 also
00:25:23.200 called
00:25:23.520 cross
00:25:24.080 entropy
00:25:25.080 so
00:25:25.240 we'll
00:25:25.440 do
00:25:25.640 that
00:25:27.080 next
00:25:28.080 the

00:25:30.640 before
00:25:30.880 we
00:25:31.080 go
00:25:31.240 and
00:25:31.480 discuss
00:25:31.960 that

00:26:25.919 quote
00:26:26.159 it
00:26:26.399 as
00:26:29.399 it's
00:26:29.640 one
00:26:29.799 and
00:26:30.000 the
00:26:30.159 same
00:26:30.440 thing
00:26:31.159 and
00:26:31.279 I
00:26:31.440 just
00:26:31.600 want
00:26:31.799 to
00:26:32.159 mention
00:26:32.600 all

00:26:33.159 just
00:26:33.320 in

00:27:14.640 you
00:27:14.799 follow
00:27:15.279 the
00:27:15.600 this

00:27:16.559 where
00:27:16.799 we

00:27:22.960 and
00:27:23.159 you
00:27:23.919 probably
00:27:24.640 understood
00:27:25.360 the

00:27:30.120 negatives
00:27:30.640 as
00:27:30.799 we
00:27:30.960 were
00:27:31.200 moving
00:27:31.760 in
00:27:31.960 fact
00:27:33.159 the

00:27:35.000 we
00:27:35.159 were
00:27:35.440 moving
00:27:36.440 the

00:27:38.399 w
00:27:39.360 we
00:27:39.520 were
00:27:40.039 changing
00:27:41.240 the

00:27:44.240 and
00:27:44.440 of
00:27:44.600 course
00:27:45.480 here
00:27:45.760 we
00:27:46.519 were
00:27:46.720 trading
00:27:47.120 all
00:27:47.360 false

00:27:48.960 in
00:27:49.120 our

00:27:49.640 to
00:27:49.799 find
00:27:50.080 this
00:27:50.279 optimal
00:27:50.720 kind
00:27:50.919 of
00:27:51.399 W
00:27:52.519 in
00:27:52.600 a
00:27:52.799 very
00:27:53.000 similar
00:27:53.399 way
00:27:53.600 we
00:27:53.720 can
00:27:53.880 actually
00:27:54.200 claim
00:27:54.559 that
00:27:54.720 now
00:27:54.919 that
00:27:55.080 we
00:27:55.279 have
00:27:56.480 the
00:27:56.760 those
00:27:57.240 metrics
00:27:58.679 the
00:27:58.840 tradeoff
00:27:59.360 between
00:27:59.640 false
00:28:00.039 positives
00:28:00.399 and
00:28:00.559 false
00:28:00.880 negatives
00:28:01.600 is
00:28:01.880 evident
00:28:02.600 over
00:28:02.960 here
00:28:03.880 U
00:28:04.760 in
00:28:05.440 the
00:28:05.600 following
00:28:05.919 trade
00:28:06.320 off
00:28:06.960 so
00:28:07.200 let
00:28:07.360 me
00:28:07.519 write
00:28:07.720 it
00:28:07.880 this
00:28:08.720 down
00:28:09.880 so
00:28:10.880 we
00:28:11.000 can
00:28:11.159 say
00:28:11.399 that
00:28:13.519 because
00:28:14.519 as
00:28:14.919 W
00:28:20.519 changes
00:28:21.519 there
00:28:21.679 is
00:28:21.880 a
00:28:24.440 tradeoff
00:28:25.600 between
00:28:30.600 false
00:28:31.039 positives
00:28:31.519 and
00:28:31.720 false
00:28:33.840 negatives
00:28:35.039 we
00:28:35.200 can
00:28:35.399 actually
00:28:35.720 claim
00:28:36.320 that
00:28:36.799 there
00:28:36.919 is
00:28:37.039 a
00:28:45.200 between
00:28:47.880 recall
00:28:48.880 and
00:28:50.799 precision
00:28:51.799 because
00:28:52.080 recall
00:28:52.399 and
00:28:52.600 precision
00:28:53.240 everything
00:28:53.559 is
00:28:53.799 exactly
00:28:54.200 the
00:28:54.360 same
00:28:55.120 in
00:28:55.320 terms
00:28:55.600 of
00:28:55.760 numerator
00:28:56.240 and
00:28:56.440 portion
00:28:56.720 of
00:28:56.840 the
00:28:56.960 denominator
00:28:57.600 but
00:28:57.720 only
00:28:58.240 the
00:28:59.320 false
00:28:59.640 POS
00:29:00.000 and
00:29:00.120 false
00:29:00.600 negatives
00:29:01.039 are
00:29:01.279 present
00:29:01.760 there
00:29:02.200 so
00:29:02.559 this
00:29:02.720 is
00:29:03.240 actually
00:29:03.480 an
00:29:03.679 important
00:29:04.039 tradeoff
00:29:04.480 that
00:29:04.640 will
00:29:04.840 be
00:29:05.600 of
00:29:06.640 great
00:29:06.960 interest
00:29:07.320 to
00:29:07.600 us
00:29:08.760 as
00:29:08.960 we
00:29:09.120 will
00:29:09.480 always
00:29:09.760 finding
00:29:10.159 ourselves
00:29:11.000 making
00:29:11.399 that
00:29:11.600 kind
00:29:11.760 of
00:29:11.919 tradeoff
00:29:12.679 for
00:29:13.200 classif
00:29:13.760 classification
00:29:14.519 architectures
00:29:15.159 we
00:29:15.279 will
00:29:15.480 be
00:29:16.279 designing
00:29:16.960 soon
00:29:18.120 the
00:29:18.399 other
00:29:21.120 metric
00:29:22.120 it's

00:30:07.039 evidently
00:30:07.600 the

00:30:10.519 and
00:30:10.880 definitely

00:30:20.880 because
00:30:21.120 there
00:30:21.240 are
00:30:21.480 probabilities
00:30:22.480 and
00:30:22.640 therefore
00:30:22.960 we'll
00:30:23.279 find
00:30:24.080 this
00:30:24.360 Cur
00:30:24.559 of

00:30:30.840 and
00:30:31.320 the
00:30:32.159 U
00:30:33.159 as
00:30:33.320 we
00:30:33.480 change
00:30:33.760 the
00:30:34.480 threshold
00:30:35.640 we
00:30:35.760 will
00:30:36.120 be
00:30:36.279 able
00:30:36.519 to
00:30:36.760 plot
00:30:37.159 to
00:30:39.720 draw
00:30:40.720 such
00:30:42.399 cures
00:30:43.399 some
00:30:44.039 of
00:30:44.240 these
00:30:44.480 curves
00:30:44.880 are
00:30:45.279 going
00:30:45.480 to
00:30:45.640 be
00:30:45.880 like
00:30:46.120 this
00:30:46.320 let
00:30:46.480 me
00:30:46.640 plot
00:30:46.960 three
00:30:51.320 cases
00:30:52.320 so
00:30:52.880 case
00:30:53.200 let's
00:30:53.440 say
00:30:54.360 a
00:30:55.360 case
00:30:55.679 b
00:30:56.519 and
00:30:56.760 case
00:30:57.000 C
00:30:59.399 and
00:30:59.639 I
00:30:59.760 think
00:30:59.880 it's
00:31:00.159 reasonable
00:31:00.600 to
00:31:01.279 understand
00:31:01.480 now
00:31:01.760 what
00:31:01.919 is
00:31:03.159 the
00:31:03.440 best
00:31:03.760 possible
00:31:04.200 classifier
00:31:04.840 we
00:31:04.919 can
00:31:05.120 ever
00:31:05.360 design
00:31:05.720 which
00:31:05.840 is
00:31:06.039 of
00:31:06.159 course
00:31:06.320 not
00:31:06.559 achievable
00:31:07.519 right
00:31:07.799 now
00:31:09.000 and
00:31:09.159 it's
00:31:09.639 not
00:31:09.840 achievable
00:31:10.320 in
00:31:10.480 any
00:31:10.720 case
00:31:10.960 we
00:31:11.159 have
00:31:12.279 such
00:31:12.600 cases
00:31:12.919 of
00:31:13.120 overlap
00:31:13.720 between
00:31:14.360 positive
00:31:14.679 and
00:31:14.840 negative
00:31:15.200 classes
00:31:16.200 and
00:31:16.519 that
00:31:17.360 point
00:31:17.720 over
00:31:18.039 here
00:31:18.880 is
00:31:19.639 this
00:31:19.760 is
00:31:19.919 the

00:31:25.480 point
00:31:31.200 this
00:31:31.440 care
00:31:31.679 as
00:31:31.840 we
00:31:32.320 discussed
00:31:32.799 is
00:31:32.960 called
00:31:42.320 characteristic
00:31:43.320 for

00:31:51.159 each
00:31:51.360 and
00:31:51.519 every

00:31:52.240 is
00:31:52.440 being

00:31:56.000 and

00:31:56.919 if
00:31:57.039 you
00:31:57.159 like
00:31:57.360 it's
00:31:58.639 ameters
00:31:59.639 adjusting
00:32:00.159 its

00:32:01.399 the
00:32:02.679 threshold
00:32:03.679 more
00:32:04.320 specifically
00:32:05.320 and
00:32:05.600 same
00:32:05.960 here
00:32:06.200 this
00:32:06.320 is
00:32:06.440 supposed
00:32:06.720 to
00:32:06.799 be
00:32:06.919 a

00:32:09.519 45°
00:32:10.720 and
00:32:10.880 let's
00:32:11.080 compare
00:32:11.519 between
00:32:12.360 three
00:32:12.600 different
00:32:13.760 classifiers
00:32:15.919 which
00:32:16.120 one
00:32:16.639 do
00:32:16.760 we
00:32:16.919 believe
00:32:17.240 that
00:32:17.399 is
00:32:17.559 actually
00:32:17.840 the
00:32:18.000 best
00:32:18.279 one
00:32:19.440 and
00:32:19.679 it's
00:32:19.880 actually
00:32:20.320 a
00:32:20.480 very
00:32:21.279 straightforward
00:32:22.000 kind
00:32:22.120 of
00:32:22.559 answer
00:32:23.720 if
00:32:23.840 we
00:32:24.039 draw
00:32:24.559 let's
00:32:24.799 say
00:32:26.760 a
00:32:26.960 horizontal
00:32:27.440 kind
00:32:27.559 of
00:32:27.679 L
00:32:27.960 line
00:32:29.080 the
00:32:29.200 classifier
00:32:30.279 a
00:32:31.279 is
00:32:32.159 offering
00:32:33.159 exactly
00:32:34.320 the
00:32:35.559 same
00:32:36.159 performance
00:32:36.880 as
00:32:38.240 recall
00:32:39.240 but
00:32:39.799 at
00:32:39.960 a
00:32:40.120 much
00:32:40.399 reduced
00:32:41.120 probability
00:32:41.679 of
00:32:41.840 false

00:32:43.120 false
00:32:43.440 positive

00:32:44.120 as
00:32:44.320 compared
00:32:44.639 to
00:32:44.799 classifier
00:32:46.039 B
00:32:47.039 and
00:32:47.240 of
00:32:47.399 course
00:32:48.000 much
00:32:48.440 better
00:32:48.720 than
00:32:48.919 classifier
00:32:49.600 C
00:32:50.600 and
00:32:50.799 therefore
00:32:51.240 either
00:32:51.480 we
00:32:51.679 draw
00:32:52.000 a
00:32:52.080 horizontal
00:32:52.600 line
00:32:52.840 or
00:32:53.039 actually
00:32:53.320 you
00:32:53.399 can
00:32:53.639 actually
00:32:53.840 draw
00:32:54.120 a
00:32:54.279 vertical
00:32:54.679 line
00:32:54.919 we
00:32:55.039 can
00:32:55.200 make
00:32:55.399 the

00:32:56.919 a

00:32:59.919 of
00:33:01.639 true
00:33:02.360 positive

00:33:03.720 compared
00:33:04.159 to

00:33:08.159 positive

00:33:09.679 and

00:33:40.480 operate
00:33:41.120 at
00:33:41.279 a

00:33:43.320 at
00:33:43.519 that
00:33:43.760 point
00:33:44.120 we
00:33:44.279 will
00:33:44.799 be
00:33:45.639 sort
00:33:45.840 of
00:33:46.039 constantly
00:33:46.840 operating
00:33:47.840 and
00:33:48.720 we
00:33:48.840 will
00:33:49.679 in
00:33:49.799 many
00:33:50.039 senses
00:33:50.360 we
00:33:50.480 will
00:33:50.600 need
00:33:50.720 to
00:33:50.880 make
00:33:51.360 different

00:33:59.480 so
00:34:00.080 let
00:34:00.240 me
00:34:00.399 write
00:34:00.679 this

00:35:10.280 will
00:35:10.480 not

00:35:11.520 exception
00:35:12.800 and
00:35:13.000 we
00:35:13.160 started
00:35:13.520 with
00:35:13.720 the

00:35:18.480 are
00:35:18.599 ultimately
00:35:19.119 connected
00:35:20.079 now
00:35:20.280 we
00:35:20.480 recognize
00:35:21.480 the

00:35:31.440 be
00:35:31.680 motivating
00:35:32.359 this
00:35:32.640 by

00:35:35.400 we
00:35:35.680 had

00:35:36.760 which
00:35:37.000 actually
00:35:37.280 was

00:35:38.720 in
00:35:39.680 binary
00:35:40.160 classification
00:35:41.079 we
00:35:41.359 going
00:35:41.480 to
00:35:41.760 need
00:35:42.000 to
00:35:42.320 actually
00:35:43.480 have
00:35:43.760 a

00:35:45.440 distribution
00:35:46.040 which
00:35:46.160 is
00:35:46.400 really
00:35:46.800 appropriate
00:35:47.400 for

00:36:52.400 -
00:36:52.839 y
00:36:53.480 let's
00:36:53.920 spend
00:36:54.200 some
00:36:54.440 time
00:36:54.640 kind
00:36:54.800 of
00:36:55.240 understanding
00:36:55.920 this
00:36:57.119 if
00:36:58.119 my
00:36:58.359 ground
00:36:58.720 truth
00:36:59.240 is
00:37:00.480 one
00:37:01.680 this
00:37:01.880 P
00:37:05.000 model
00:37:06.000 of
00:37:06.240 Y
00:37:07.079 had
00:37:08.079 of
00:37:08.319 Y
00:37:08.560 sorry
00:37:09.119 given
00:37:10.160 X
00:37:11.160 comma
00:37:11.599 W
00:37:12.560 is
00:37:12.920 simply
00:37:14.599 y
00:37:15.800 because
00:37:16.680 the
00:37:16.880 Y
00:37:17.079 is
00:37:17.720 one
00:37:18.040 so
00:37:18.280 this
00:37:18.400 is
00:37:18.640 zero
00:37:19.119 and
00:37:19.319 therefore
00:37:19.680 this
00:37:19.839 term
00:37:20.119 hole
00:37:20.359 is
00:37:20.520 one
00:37:20.760 so
00:37:20.960 the
00:37:21.079 only
00:37:21.240 thing
00:37:21.400 that
00:37:21.720 remains
00:37:21.920 is
00:37:22.440 y
00:37:23.440 and
00:37:23.599 in
00:37:23.800 fact
00:37:24.200 this
00:37:24.319 is
00:37:24.400 a
00:37:24.640 very
00:37:25.480 important
00:37:28.359 in
00:37:28.480 a
00:37:28.680 sense
00:37:29.040 that
00:37:30.480 from
00:37:30.760 now
00:37:31.520 on

00:37:33.160 classification
00:37:34.079 all

00:37:34.400 need
00:37:34.599 to

00:37:35.079 at
00:37:35.280 the

00:37:41.800 so
00:37:41.960 it's
00:37:42.079 a

00:38:32.839 Y
00:38:33.240 in
00:38:33.440 this
00:38:33.880 case
00:38:34.880 so
00:38:35.560 the

00:38:39.000 so
00:38:39.359 that's
00:38:40.560 that
00:38:40.680 is
00:38:40.880 what
00:38:41.040 our

00:38:59.480 going
00:38:59.760 to
00:39:00.720 let's
00:39:00.880 say
00:39:01.079 report

00:39:05.760 class
00:39:06.680 and
00:39:06.839 this
00:39:06.960 means
00:39:07.319 that
00:39:07.560 we
00:39:07.680 are
00:39:07.880 going

00:39:08.400 82%
00:39:09.400 certain

00:39:11.200 event
00:39:11.599 at

00:39:12.839 of
00:39:13.000 our
00:39:13.160 classif
00:39:13.640 fire
00:39:13.920 and
00:39:14.160 if
00:39:14.319 we
00:39:14.520 have
00:39:14.800 already
00:39:15.319 reported
00:39:15.839 the

00:39:16.560 of
00:39:16.640 a

00:39:17.200 event
00:39:18.200 then
00:39:20.040 when
00:39:20.240 we
00:39:20.359 are
00:39:20.520 dealing

00:39:23.000 our
00:39:23.520 P
00:39:23.760 model
00:39:24.160 over
00:39:24.480 here
00:39:25.359 that
00:39:25.520 we
00:39:25.680 have
00:39:25.880 selected

00:39:27.560 given
00:39:27.880 X
00:39:28.119 comma
00:39:28.400 W
00:39:29.040 will
00:39:29.240 be
00:39:29.400 simply
00:39:29.720 be
00:39:29.920 1
00:39:30.160 minus
00:39:30.800 y
00:39:32.560 because
00:39:33.960 with

00:39:34.319 is
00:39:34.400 equal

00:39:34.839 zero
00:39:35.200 then
00:39:35.520 this

00:39:38.200 minus
00:39:38.599 y
00:39:38.839 hat
00:39:39.160 so
00:39:39.480 immediately
00:39:40.040 we
00:39:40.160 can
00:39:41.720 get

00:39:48.560 in
00:39:48.680 fact
00:39:48.839 I
00:39:48.920 don't
00:39:49.040 need

00:39:52.000 maybe
00:39:52.240 I
00:39:52.319 can
00:39:52.520 do
00:39:53.000 maybe
00:39:53.200 I
00:39:53.319 can
00:39:53.520 write
00:39:53.880 P
00:39:55.760 model
00:39:56.760 of

00:39:57.680 is
00:39:57.839 equal
00:39:58.119 to
00:39:58.280 Z
00:39:58.640 given
00:39:58.960 X
00:39:59.240 comma
00:39:59.800 W
00:40:00.800 and
00:40:01.000 this
00:40:01.160 was
00:40:01.400 shown
00:40:01.720 to

00:40:02.079 1
00:40:02.319 -
00:40:02.760 y
00:40:03.760 so
00:40:03.920 I
00:40:04.040 don't
00:40:04.359 even
00:40:04.599 need
00:40:04.800 to
00:40:05.160 produce
00:40:06.240 a

00:40:06.720 in
00:40:06.880 the

00:40:07.760 of
00:40:07.920 my
00:40:08.119 binary
00:40:08.480 classifier
00:40:09.240 just
00:40:09.440 with
00:40:09.680 one
00:40:10.119 value
00:40:11.319 from
00:40:11.599 that
00:40:11.839 value
00:40:12.119 I
00:40:12.440 can
00:40:13.440 deterministically
00:40:14.280 obtain
00:40:15.160 the

00:40:15.800 the
00:40:15.960 negative
00:40:16.800 class
00:40:17.800 so
00:40:18.000 if
00:40:18.119 I
00:40:18.280 have
00:40:18.480 produced
00:40:19.319 0.8
00:40:20.319 for
00:40:20.560 the
00:40:20.760 positive
00:40:21.160 class
00:40:21.720 then
00:40:21.920 the
00:40:22.520 probability
00:40:24.040 of
00:40:24.319 the

00:40:25.200 is
00:40:25.280 0.2
00:40:27.839 okay
00:40:28.040 so
00:40:28.280 that's
00:40:29.240 kind
00:40:29.359 of
00:40:29.520 an
00:40:29.720 important

00:40:30.760 of

00:40:34.560 which
00:40:34.720 is
00:40:35.040 obviously
00:40:35.520 very
00:40:35.760 appropriate
00:40:36.359 for

00:41:45.599 had
00:41:45.839 distribution
00:41:46.680 is
00:41:47.440 effectively
00:41:48.079 the

00:42:06.920 earlier
00:42:07.440 it's

00:43:21.240 so
00:43:21.480 let's
00:43:22.200 plug

00:43:31.119 we

00:46:33.640 truth
00:46:33.920 agrees
00:46:34.319 with
00:46:34.480 me
00:46:34.880 then
00:46:35.200 I'm
00:46:35.400 expected
00:46:35.760 to
00:46:36.599 get
00:46:37.960 the
00:46:38.079 inner
00:46:38.400 term
00:46:38.640 to
00:46:38.760 be
00:46:38.960 zero
00:46:39.720 as
00:46:40.000 intuitively
00:46:40.599 understood
00:46:41.119 I'm
00:46:41.520 100%
00:46:41.960 in
00:46:42.119 agreement
00:46:42.640 with
00:46:42.880 the
00:46:43.640 ground
00:46:43.960 truth
00:46:44.800 here
00:46:46.079 the
00:46:46.960 on
00:46:47.119 the
00:46:47.240 other
00:46:47.480 hand
00:46:47.800 when
00:46:48.000 I'm
00:46:48.200 predicting
00:46:48.640 the
00:46:48.880 Y
00:46:49.119 had
00:46:49.400 to
00:46:49.760 be
00:46:51.599 0
00:46:51.960 point
00:46:52.200 let's
00:46:52.359 say
00:46:52.480 05
00:46:53.400 over
00:46:54.480 here
00:46:55.480 and
00:46:55.760 this
00:46:55.920 means
00:46:56.280 that
00:46:56.440 I'm
00:46:57.720 predicting
00:46:59.079 the
00:46:59.280 positive
00:47:00.280 to
00:47:00.480 be
00:47:01.599 0.05
00:47:02.599 and
00:47:03.280 in
00:47:03.440 other
00:47:03.640 words
00:47:03.880 I'm
00:47:04.040 predicting
00:47:04.680 the
00:47:04.960 negative
00:47:05.440 to
00:47:05.760 be
00:47:07.680 0.95
00:47:08.680 I'm
00:47:08.960 predicting
00:47:09.480 that
00:47:09.640 a
00:47:09.920 no
00:47:10.200 attack
00:47:10.480 has
00:47:10.680 happened
00:47:11.000 with
00:47:11.599 95%
00:47:13.319 confidence
00:47:14.720 then
00:47:14.880 I'm
00:47:15.040 actually
00:47:15.359 going
00:47:15.599 to
00:47:16.040 and
00:47:16.240 my
00:47:16.400 ground
00:47:16.680 Ruth
00:47:17.000 disagrees
00:47:17.559 with
00:47:17.760 me
00:47:18.760 I
00:47:18.880 am
00:47:19.119 going
00:47:19.359 to
00:47:20.359 incure
00:47:20.800 a
00:47:20.960 huge
00:47:22.440 loss
00:47:23.559 so
00:47:23.720 I
00:47:23.839 can
00:47:24.000 actually
00:47:24.359 sufficient
00:47:24.839 to
00:47:25.000 say
00:47:25.319 here
00:47:25.720 that
00:47:26.160 BC
00:47:34.640 confident
00:47:36.319 wrong
00:47:42.960 decisions
00:47:43.960 such
00:47:44.200 as
00:47:46.280 0.95
00:47:47.280 but
00:47:47.520 wrong
00:47:53.640 decisions
00:47:54.640 and
00:47:54.839 actually
00:47:55.119 can
00:47:55.280 draw
00:47:55.559 also
00:47:55.920 the
00:47:57.079 kind
00:47:57.240 of
00:47:57.440 corresponding
00:47:58.200 care
00:48:03.119 for
00:48:04.119 y
00:48:04.319 is
00:48:04.480 equal
00:48:04.720 to
00:48:05.680 Z
00:48:08.920 zero
00:48:09.920 and
00:48:10.079 it
00:48:10.480 should
00:48:10.640 be
00:48:11.319 symmetric
00:48:12.319 obviously
00:48:12.640 in
00:48:12.760 the
00:48:12.880 handwritten
00:48:13.400 kind
00:48:13.559 of
00:48:13.760 way
00:48:14.040 this
00:48:14.160 is
00:48:14.359 they
00:48:14.440 are
00:48:14.599 not
00:48:15.319 symmetric
00:48:15.839 here
00:48:16.079 but
00:48:16.680 this
00:48:16.800 is
00:48:17.280 kind
00:48:17.440 of
00:48:17.720 quite
00:48:17.960 important
00:48:18.280 to
00:48:18.520 realize
00:48:19.040 the
00:48:19.480 behavior
00:48:20.000 of
00:48:20.200 binary
00:48:20.559 cross
00:48:21.359 penalizing
00:48:22.359 confident
00:48:22.920 wrong
00:48:23.240 decisions
00:48:27.880 so
00:48:28.119 now
00:48:28.319 we
00:48:28.559 have
00:48:29.160 everything
00:48:29.520 that
00:48:29.680 we
00:48:29.800 need
00:48:29.920 to
00:48:30.079 draw
00:48:30.280 a
00:48:30.400 block
00:48:31.079 diagram
00:48:32.079 and
00:48:32.520 this
00:48:32.680 block
00:48:32.960 diagram
00:48:33.800 is
00:48:33.960 applicable
00:48:34.480 in
00:48:34.640 fact
00:48:35.640 to
00:48:36.640 all
00:48:36.880 sorts
00:48:37.200 of
00:48:37.800 predictors
00:48:38.800 and
00:48:39.079 we
00:48:39.240 have
00:48:39.520 already
00:48:40.520 seen
00:48:40.920 regression
00:48:41.400 now
00:48:41.599 in
00:48:41.960 classification
00:48:42.960 so
00:48:43.160 let
00:48:43.240 me
00:48:43.440 just
00:48:43.599 throw
00:48:44.359 the
00:48:45.359 predictor
00:48:46.079 as
00:48:47.000 this
00:48:47.240 box
00:48:47.559 over
00:48:52.559 here
00:48:53.559 we
00:48:53.680 have
00:48:53.839 seen
00:48:54.079 that
00:48:54.160 in
00:48:54.280 the

00:48:54.880 setting
00:48:55.400 a

00:48:57.520 in
00:48:57.599 other

00:48:58.440 between
00:48:59.839 the

00:49:00.680 vector
00:49:01.520 and
00:49:02.200 features
00:49:03.200 and
00:49:03.559 we
00:49:03.720 also
00:49:03.920 seeing
00:49:04.480 here
00:49:05.680 a
00:49:05.920 classifier
00:49:06.920 but
00:49:07.040 we
00:49:07.160 have
00:49:07.319 not
00:49:07.480 really
00:49:07.839 discussed
00:49:08.319 yet
00:49:08.599 the
00:49:09.000 functional
00:49:09.480 form
00:49:09.799 of
00:49:10.000 what
00:49:10.280 the

00:49:11.079 will
00:49:11.280 actually
00:49:11.599 be
00:49:12.200 but
00:49:12.400 whatever
00:49:12.960 this

00:49:14.200 is
00:49:15.640 going
00:49:15.960 to
00:49:16.960 so
00:49:17.280 this
00:49:17.400 is
00:49:17.960 either
00:49:18.200 for

00:49:29.119 it
00:49:29.400 has

00:49:35.319 and
00:49:36.000 over
00:49:36.240 here
00:49:36.480 we're
00:49:36.599 going
00:49:36.720 to
00:49:38.960 have
00:49:39.960 the
00:49:41.680 let's
00:49:41.960 assume
00:49:42.240 that
00:49:42.400 this
00:49:42.480 is
00:49:42.760 now
00:49:43.240 for
00:49:44.359 U
00:49:45.359 I
00:49:45.440 mean
00:49:45.720 let's
00:49:45.960 call
00:49:46.160 it
00:49:46.280 a
00:49:46.440 loss
00:49:46.880 function
00:49:47.880 and
00:49:48.000 the
00:49:48.119 loss
00:49:48.400 function
00:49:48.760 will
00:49:48.960 be
00:49:49.760 the
00:49:49.920 mean
00:49:50.200 square
00:49:50.720 error
00:49:52.359 or
00:49:53.520 the

00:49:54.160 entropy
00:49:55.079 in
00:49:55.240 fact
00:49:56.079 the
00:49:56.240 we
00:49:56.359 will
00:49:56.720 show
00:49:57.000 that
00:49:57.200 the
00:49:57.359 cross
00:49:57.799 entropy
00:49:59.040 is
00:49:59.200 able
00:49:59.520 to
00:49:59.720 accommodate
00:50:00.319 both
00:50:00.520 mean
00:50:00.799 square
00:50:01.079 error
00:50:02.319 as

00:50:03.200 and
00:50:03.440 as
00:50:04.040 well
00:50:04.200 also
00:50:04.440 the

00:50:04.920 concenter
00:50:05.359 we
00:50:05.799 have
00:50:06.000 just
00:50:06.160 seen
00:50:06.920 so
00:50:07.160 the

00:50:07.599 of
00:50:07.720 this

00:50:08.440 function
00:50:08.960 so
00:50:09.160 this

00:50:09.599 function
00:50:09.880 should

00:50:14.920 are
00:50:15.240 going
00:50:15.440 to

00:50:25.520 then
00:50:25.680 the

00:50:28.040 is
00:50:28.480 going

00:51:16.079 will
00:51:16.400 provide
00:51:16.799 for
00:51:17.160 us
00:51:18.160 and
00:51:18.319 will
00:51:18.520 update
00:51:18.880 for
00:51:19.079 us
00:51:19.319 the

00:51:20.200 W
00:51:21.200 of
00:51:21.440 all
00:51:21.640 the
00:51:21.799 parameters
00:51:22.359 involved
00:51:22.839 inside
00:51:23.240 this
00:51:23.559 predictor
00:51:24.559 so
00:51:24.760 this
00:51:24.880 is
00:51:24.960 a

00:51:25.640 block
00:51:25.920 diagram
00:51:26.280 that
00:51:26.400 we
00:51:26.720 allow
00:51:27.280 us
00:51:28.280 to
00:51:30.839 train
00:51:31.839 and
00:51:32.520 therefore
00:51:35.280 optimize
00:51:36.280 any
00:51:37.200 machine
00:51:37.599 Any
00:51:37.799 prediction
00:51:38.200 machine
00:51:38.520 we
00:51:38.720 have
00:51:39.480 seen
00:51:39.920 up
00:51:40.079 to
00:51:40.280 this
