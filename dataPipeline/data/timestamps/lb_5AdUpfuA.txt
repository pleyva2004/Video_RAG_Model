00:00:00.480 in
00:00:00.599 an
00:00:00.760 earlier
00:00:01.120 video
00:00:01.360 we
00:00:01.480 saw
00:00:01.760 the
00:00:01.920 structure
00:00:02.320 of
00:00:02.440 the

00:00:04.319 and
00:00:04.920 how
00:00:05.200 many
00:00:05.759 of
00:00:05.960 these
00:00:06.160 neurons
00:00:06.879 in
00:00:07.000 the
00:00:07.120 form
00:00:07.319 of
00:00:07.760 filters
00:00:08.760 are
00:00:09.760 you
00:00:09.880 know
00:00:10.080 coming
00:00:10.480 together
00:00:10.719 to
00:00:10.880 form
00:00:11.120 a

00:00:11.920 and
00:00:12.160 how
00:00:12.639 the
00:00:13.120 multiple
00:00:13.559 layers
00:00:14.240 are
00:00:14.960 coming
00:00:15.320 again
00:00:15.719 together
00:00:16.320 stacked
00:00:17.439 to
00:00:18.119 implement
00:00:18.680 this
00:00:20.119 binary
00:00:20.560 classification
00:00:21.439 task
00:00:22.279 in
00:00:22.480 this
00:00:23.199 video
00:00:23.560 that
00:00:23.720 we
00:00:23.840 have
00:00:24.119 looked
00:00:24.359 at
00:00:24.880 on
00:00:25.119 cats
00:00:25.480 versus
00:00:26.279 dogs
00:00:27.279 now
00:00:27.519 we
00:00:27.640 will
00:00:27.800 be
00:00:27.960 using
00:00:28.359 exactly
00:00:28.800 the
00:00:28.960 same
00:00:30.080 model
00:00:30.599 that
00:00:30.759 we
00:00:30.880 have
00:00:31.039 built
00:00:31.320 for
00:00:31.519 that
00:00:31.720 kind
00:00:31.880 of
00:00:32.079 task
00:00:32.399 and
00:00:32.559 in
00:00:32.759 this
00:00:32.960 specific
00:00:33.879 case
00:00:34.200 what
00:00:34.320 we
00:00:34.480 were
00:00:34.680 interested
00:00:35.160 now
00:00:35.320 to
00:00:35.480 see
00:00:35.719 is
00:00:35.840 to
00:00:36.079 validate
00:00:36.680 what
00:00:36.800 we
00:00:36.960 have
00:00:37.120 said
00:00:37.399 earlier
00:00:38.360 about
00:00:38.879 the
00:00:39.200 some
00:00:39.480 kind
00:00:39.640 of
00:00:39.760 a
00:00:39.920 structure
00:00:40.399 or
00:00:40.640 pattern
00:00:41.000 that
00:00:41.160 we
00:00:41.320 see
00:00:42.079 in
00:00:42.280 the
00:00:42.719 features
00:00:44.000 that
00:00:44.600 the
00:00:44.960 convolution
00:00:45.559 UN
00:00:45.800 networks
00:00:46.239 kind
00:00:46.360 of
00:00:46.520 learn
00:00:47.320 so
00:00:47.480 in
00:00:47.640 this
00:00:47.960 notebook
00:00:48.399 borrowed
00:00:48.840 from
00:00:49.079 the
00:00:49.320 book
00:00:49.800 deep
00:00:50.039 learning
00:00:50.399 with
00:00:51.079 python
00:00:52.079 what
00:00:52.239 we
00:00:52.520 actually
00:00:53.600 can
00:00:53.760 see
00:00:54.440 a
00:00:54.559 couple
00:00:54.800 of
00:00:54.960 things
00:00:55.199 the
00:00:55.399 first
00:00:56.160 is
00:00:56.399 the
00:00:56.559 so-called
00:00:57.559 U
00:00:58.399 the

00:01:01.000 Network
00:01:01.760 outputs
00:01:02.920 these
00:01:03.079 are
00:01:03.719 effectively
00:01:04.600 what
00:01:04.879 are
00:01:05.680 each
00:01:05.960 layer
00:01:06.600 kind
00:01:06.799 of
00:01:07.520 presents
00:01:08.000 to
00:01:08.159 the
00:01:08.240 layer
00:01:08.600 above
00:01:08.920 it
00:01:09.799 and
00:01:10.040 I
00:01:10.159 think
00:01:10.320 it's
00:01:10.520 worthwhile
00:01:11.320 kind
00:01:11.479 of
00:01:11.799 going
00:01:12.400 through
00:01:12.640 that
00:01:13.320 first
00:01:14.320 and
00:01:14.960 as
00:01:15.119 we
00:01:15.240 said
00:01:15.520 this
00:01:15.640 is
00:01:16.240 the
00:01:16.799 sort
00:01:17.040 of
00:01:17.240 exactly
00:01:17.560 the
00:01:17.680 same
00:01:17.880 architecture
00:01:18.439 we
00:01:18.560 have
00:01:18.680 seen
00:01:18.920 earlier
00:01:19.360 for
00:01:19.600 that
00:01:20.079 specific

00:01:21.320 set
00:01:22.320 and
00:01:22.759 this
00:01:22.880 is
00:01:23.040 the

00:01:27.200 150
00:01:27.680 by
00:01:27.840 150
00:01:28.439 pixels

00:01:29.680 Rec
00:01:29.920 col
00:01:30.840 images
00:01:31.840 and
00:01:32.799 this
00:01:32.920 is
00:01:33.200 the
00:01:34.640 you
00:01:34.759 know
00:01:35.079 first
00:01:35.680 layer
00:01:36.399 what
00:01:36.799 it
00:01:37.040 really
00:01:37.280 learns
00:01:37.720 and
00:01:38.320 as
00:01:38.439 you
00:01:38.600 can
00:01:38.920 see
00:01:40.079 the

00:01:41.479 kind
00:01:41.600 of
00:01:41.720 feature
00:01:42.360 map
00:01:43.360 it
00:01:43.560 kind
00:01:43.720 of
00:01:44.320 presents
00:01:45.960 an
00:01:46.560 almost
00:01:48.119 identical
00:01:49.280 figure
00:01:49.759 to
00:01:50.119 the

00:01:53.960 picture
00:01:54.640 input
00:01:55.040 image
00:01:55.479 except
00:01:56.360 that
00:01:57.200 this
00:01:57.840 image
00:01:58.200 over
00:01:58.479 here
00:01:58.799 emphasizes
00:01:59.479 the
00:01:59.600 edge
00:02:00.600 so
00:02:00.799 these
00:02:00.960 are
00:02:01.240 the
00:02:01.520 as
00:02:01.640 we
00:02:01.759 said
00:02:02.000 the
00:02:02.560 Primitive
00:02:03.039 kind
00:02:03.200 of

00:02:03.680 that
00:02:03.840 the

00:02:04.840 initial
00:02:05.280 layers
00:02:05.799 of
00:02:06.039 the
00:02:06.640 conet
00:02:07.640 are
00:02:08.000 actually
00:02:08.840 learning
00:02:09.840 and
00:02:10.000 we
00:02:10.119 can
00:02:10.319 actually
00:02:10.599 go
00:02:11.000 and
00:02:11.599 look
00:02:11.800 at
00:02:12.040 each
00:02:12.239 and
00:02:12.440 every
00:02:13.400 layer
00:02:14.400 and
00:02:15.080 I
00:02:15.200 think
00:02:15.480 the
00:02:16.040 over
00:02:16.319 here
00:02:16.560 I
00:02:16.680 think
00:02:16.920 this
00:02:18.080 IM
00:02:18.959 figure
00:02:19.319 over
00:02:19.560 here
00:02:19.760 shows
00:02:20.720 what
00:02:20.879 is
00:02:21.080 really
00:02:21.720 happening
00:02:22.239 so
00:02:23.120 the
00:02:23.239 initial
00:02:23.640 layers
00:02:24.280 are
00:02:25.239 learning
00:02:26.400 I
00:02:26.519 will
00:02:26.720 call
00:02:26.879 it
00:02:27.080 a
00:02:27.319 visual
00:02:27.800 content
00:02:28.319 the
00:02:28.480 same
00:02:28.760 kind
00:02:28.920 of
00:02:29.040 visual
00:02:29.360 content
00:02:29.680 as
00:02:30.280 our
00:02:31.160 eyes
00:02:31.480 kind
00:02:31.680 of
00:02:31.840 see
00:02:32.160 in
00:02:32.319 the
00:02:32.519 image
00:02:34.440 let's
00:02:34.640 say
00:02:34.920 you
00:02:35.040 can
00:02:35.280 very
00:02:35.480 clearly
00:02:35.840 see
00:02:36.959 the
00:02:37.120 shape
00:02:37.360 and
00:02:37.519 form
00:02:37.879 of
00:02:38.400 the
00:02:38.560 of
00:02:38.680 the
00:02:38.879 cut
00:02:39.159 over
00:02:39.480 here
00:02:40.040 but
00:02:40.280 as
00:02:40.400 we
00:02:40.680 actually
00:02:41.040 going
00:02:41.840 further
00:02:42.760 deeper
00:02:43.239 into
00:02:43.680 the
00:02:44.319 network
00:02:45.319 then
00:02:46.080 the
00:02:47.040 representations
00:02:47.800 that
00:02:48.000 are
00:02:48.159 actually
00:02:48.519 being
00:02:48.800 created
00:02:49.239 are
00:02:49.760 becoming
00:02:51.519 more
00:02:51.760 and
00:02:51.920 more
00:02:52.280 abstract
00:02:53.080 to
00:02:53.239 the
00:02:53.480 point
00:02:53.959 where
00:02:54.360 this
00:02:54.480 is
00:02:54.640 the
00:02:54.879 fifth
00:02:55.200 layer
00:02:56.080 as
00:02:56.200 you
00:02:56.319 can
00:02:56.480 see
00:02:56.680 from
00:02:56.920 that
00:02:57.120 point
00:02:57.360 onwards
00:02:57.800 we
00:02:58.000 still
00:02:58.239 see
00:02:58.560 some
00:02:59.560 of
00:03:00.040 the
00:03:01.599 feature
00:03:02.120 maps
00:03:03.120 that
00:03:03.360 are
00:03:03.599 being
00:03:03.879 created
00:03:04.319 remember
00:03:04.640 the

00:03:05.080 maps
00:03:05.480 that

00:03:05.720 being
00:03:05.920 created
00:03:06.239 are
00:03:06.440 volumes
00:03:06.920 so
00:03:07.120 what
00:03:07.319 actually
00:03:07.599 we
00:03:07.799 see
00:03:08.120 here
00:03:08.400 are
00:03:09.319 the
00:03:10.159 flattened
00:03:10.840 version
00:03:11.239 of
00:03:11.480 those
00:03:11.920 volumes
00:03:12.560 so
00:03:12.720 we
00:03:12.879 plot
00:03:13.239 here
00:03:13.480 the
00:03:14.120 special
00:03:15.280 dimensions
00:03:16.280 that
00:03:16.400 are
00:03:16.599 coming
00:03:17.040 at
00:03:17.480 the

00:03:19.159 on
00:03:19.799 each

00:03:20.560 but
00:03:21.000 we
00:03:21.120 are
00:03:21.599 effectively
00:03:22.640 flattening
00:03:23.920 all
00:03:24.080 of
00:03:24.319 the
00:03:25.120 filters
00:03:25.640 that
00:03:25.840 we
00:03:26.000 have
00:03:26.480 U
00:03:27.319 used
00:03:28.519 all

00:03:31.080 used
00:03:31.760 to
00:03:32.400 create
00:03:32.840 this
00:03:33.480 volume
00:03:34.439 so
00:03:34.720 here
00:03:34.920 you
00:03:35.200 have

00:03:39.280 can
00:03:39.400 see
00:03:39.680 here
00:03:39.959 we
00:03:40.439 from
00:03:40.599 the
00:03:40.760 seventh
00:03:41.200 layer
00:03:41.560 onwards
00:03:42.159 we
00:03:42.280 are
00:03:42.519 not
00:03:42.760 really
00:03:43.120 able
00:03:43.439 to
00:03:43.799 see
00:03:48.080 any
00:03:48.360 of
00:03:48.560 the
00:03:50.080 sort
00:03:50.319 of
00:03:51.319 visual
00:03:51.799 characteristics
00:03:52.560 of
00:03:53.079 a
00:03:53.280 cut
00:03:53.760 so
00:03:54.439 this
00:03:54.680 become
00:03:55.040 a
00:03:55.360 fairly
00:03:55.760 abstract
00:03:56.280 kind
00:03:56.400 of
00:03:57.280 representation
00:03:58.280 here
00:03:58.519 you
00:03:58.599 can
00:03:58.760 actually
00:03:59.040 also
00:03:59.239 see
00:03:59.439 very
00:03:59.840 clearly
00:04:00.239 the
00:04:00.439 impact
00:04:00.840 of
00:04:01.079 Max
00:04:01.680 pooling
00:04:02.680 and
00:04:03.000 how
00:04:03.400 we
00:04:03.519 can
00:04:03.720 actually
00:04:04.040 start
00:04:04.519 with
00:04:05.159 a
00:04:05.480 representation
00:04:06.480 and
00:04:06.799 what
00:04:07.000 is
00:04:07.239 the
00:04:07.920 max
00:04:08.280 pooling
00:04:08.680 operator
00:04:09.120 with
00:04:09.280 a

00:04:09.799 of
00:04:09.920 2
00:04:10.519 2x
00:04:10.959 two
00:04:11.239 is
00:04:11.439 actually
00:04:11.720 doing
00:04:12.000 is
00:04:12.200 actually
00:04:12.439 picking
00:04:12.760 at
00:04:12.920 the
00:04:13.200 more
00:04:14.200 essential
00:04:14.879 kind
00:04:15.040 of
00:04:15.799 in
00:04:16.120 features
00:04:16.519 that
00:04:16.680 are
00:04:16.880 presented
00:04:17.280 to
00:04:17.600 it
00:04:18.600 so
00:04:18.759 if
00:04:18.880 you
00:04:19.040 compare
00:04:19.519 this
00:04:19.720 image
00:04:20.120 and
00:04:20.320 this
00:04:20.959 image
00:04:22.160 and
00:04:22.639 so
00:04:22.919 that's
00:04:23.800 effectively
00:04:24.280 at
00:04:24.440 this
00:04:24.880 point
00:04:25.400 we
00:04:25.639 have
00:04:26.560 the
00:04:26.960 representations
00:04:27.919 that
00:04:28.919 are
00:04:29.880 going
00:04:30.120 to
00:04:30.280 be
00:04:30.639 needed
00:04:31.320 after
00:04:31.600 the
00:04:31.759 stochastic
00:04:32.280 rated
00:04:32.600 descent
00:04:32.960 kind
00:04:33.120 of
00:04:33.720 converges
00:04:34.720 and
00:04:34.960 provided
00:04:35.360 we
00:04:35.520 don't
00:04:35.720 have
00:04:35.919 any
00:04:36.080 over
00:04:36.400 fitting
00:04:36.759 and
00:04:36.880 so
00:04:37.120 on
00:04:38.160 these
00:04:38.400 representations
00:04:39.120 are
00:04:39.360 the
00:04:39.520 ones
00:04:39.720 that
00:04:39.919 we
00:04:40.039 are
00:04:40.160 going
00:04:40.320 to
00:04:40.479 be
00:04:41.560 flattening
00:04:42.720 to
00:04:43.440 and
00:04:43.600 then
00:04:43.759 feed
00:04:44.160 them
00:04:44.800 into
00:04:45.360 the
00:04:46.320 fully
00:04:46.680 connected
00:04:47.680 layers
00:04:48.560 that
00:04:48.800 constitute
00:04:49.320 our
00:04:49.600 head
00:04:50.400 and
00:04:50.880 if
00:04:51.080 everything
00:04:51.440 goes
00:04:51.759 okay
00:04:52.120 this
00:04:52.360 head
00:04:52.600 will
00:04:52.880 actually
00:04:53.120 see
00:04:53.880 and
00:04:54.080 work
00:04:54.320 on
00:04:54.560 those
00:04:55.000 representations
00:04:55.759 to
00:04:56.000 actually
00:04:56.360 do
00:04:56.680 the
00:04:56.840 binary
00:04:57.840 classification
00:04:58.840 Okay
00:04:59.039 so
00:05:00.199 this
00:05:00.320 is
00:05:00.560 what
00:05:00.840 we
00:05:01.120 have
00:05:01.479 seen
00:05:02.600 we
00:05:02.720 can
00:05:02.880 actually
00:05:03.120 see
00:05:03.360 in
00:05:03.520 the
00:05:04.160 feature
00:05:04.560 maps
00:05:05.520 and
00:05:05.680 I
00:05:05.800 think
00:05:05.960 it's
00:05:06.120 also
00:05:06.400 worthwhile
00:05:07.280 understanding
00:05:07.680 what
00:05:07.880 we
00:05:08.080 actually
00:05:08.360 see
00:05:08.680 now
00:05:09.560 in
00:05:10.800 as
00:05:10.919 far
00:05:11.080 as
00:05:11.199 the
00:05:11.320 filters
00:05:11.800 what
00:05:12.000 really
00:05:12.280 the
00:05:12.440 filters
00:05:13.160 the
00:05:13.320 contents
00:05:13.720 of
00:05:13.919 those
00:05:14.120 filters
00:05:15.000 are
00:05:16.000 to
00:05:16.240 visualize
00:05:16.800 those
00:05:17.080 filters
00:05:18.080 what
00:05:18.240 we
00:05:18.440 actually
00:05:18.759 do
00:05:19.000 is
00:05:19.199 we
00:05:19.400 Define
00:05:19.720 a
00:05:19.960 specific
00:05:20.400 loss
00:05:20.759 function
00:05:21.199 the
00:05:21.360 details
00:05:21.720 are
00:05:21.919 kind
00:05:22.080 of
00:05:22.240 outside
00:05:22.639 of
00:05:22.840 this
00:05:23.280 course
00:05:24.280 of
00:05:24.479 the
00:05:24.600 scope
00:05:24.880 of
00:05:25.000 this
00:05:25.160 course
00:05:25.800 but
00:05:26.240 the
00:05:26.840 at
00:05:27.000 a
00:05:27.280 high
00:05:27.520 level
00:05:27.960 what
00:05:28.080 we
00:05:28.280 do
00:05:28.479 is
00:05:28.600 we
00:05:28.800 try
00:05:29.039 to
00:05:29.199 find
00:05:30.199 input
00:05:30.639 images
00:05:31.160 that
00:05:31.720 maximize
00:05:32.720 the
00:05:32.919 activations
00:05:33.800 that
00:05:34.000 those
00:05:34.199 filters
00:05:35.039 produce
00:05:36.039 and
00:05:36.880 therefore
00:05:37.360 in
00:05:37.520 the
00:05:37.800 process
00:05:38.080 of
00:05:38.240 doing
00:05:38.520 so
00:05:38.800 we
00:05:38.919 are
00:05:39.120 able
00:05:39.440 to
00:05:40.400 out
00:05:40.520 of
00:05:40.680 this
00:05:40.840 optimization
00:05:41.800 process
00:05:42.080 to
00:05:42.199 retrieve
00:05:42.680 those
00:05:42.840 filter
00:05:43.280 values
00:05:43.759 so
00:05:44.000 here
00:05:44.199 we
00:05:44.560 see
00:05:45.800 just
00:05:46.000 the
00:05:46.160 first
00:05:46.479 64
00:05:47.479 filters
00:05:48.160 out
00:05:48.360 of
00:05:48.600 the
00:05:48.840 many
00:05:49.080 more
00:05:49.319 that
00:05:49.479 we
00:05:49.600 have
00:05:49.759 used
00:05:50.120 I
00:05:50.240 think
00:05:50.759 we
00:05:50.960 used
00:05:51.600 all
00:05:51.800 the
00:05:51.919 way
00:05:52.080 up
00:05:52.199 to
00:05:52.360 256
00:05:53.160 filters
00:05:54.160 but
00:05:54.400 we
00:05:54.639 here
00:05:54.800 we
00:05:54.919 see
00:05:55.120 the
00:05:55.280 first
00:05:55.759 64
00:05:56.360 filters
00:05:56.840 in
00:05:57.039 a
00:05:57.199 8
00:05:57.560 by8
00:05:58.080 kind
00:05:58.240 of
00:05:58.440 pattern
00:05:59.840 and
00:06:00.400 as
00:06:00.520 you
00:06:00.639 can
00:06:00.840 actually
00:06:01.160 see
00:06:02.319 the
00:06:02.759 U
00:06:03.199 this
00:06:03.560 filter
00:06:04.000 over
00:06:04.280 here
00:06:04.600 is
00:06:06.960 for
00:06:07.120 the
00:06:07.240 various
00:06:07.680 kind
00:06:07.840 of
00:06:08.000 layers
00:06:08.520 so
00:06:08.840 these
00:06:09.000 are
00:06:09.560 effectively
00:06:10.120 we
00:06:10.280 have
00:06:10.560 the
00:06:11.080 layers
00:06:11.560 going
00:06:11.880 from
00:06:12.120 the
00:06:12.880 beginning
00:06:13.360 of
00:06:13.599 this

00:06:14.919 of
00:06:15.120 the
00:06:15.759 beginning
00:06:16.080 of
00:06:16.240 the
00:06:16.759 network
00:06:17.880 all
00:06:18.120 the
00:06:18.280 way
00:06:18.599 to
00:06:19.440 the
00:06:19.880 U
00:06:20.599 towards
00:06:21.120 the
00:06:22.280 just
00:06:22.479 before
00:06:22.800 the
00:06:23.240 head
00:06:24.240 of
00:06:24.479 this
00:06:25.039 so
00:06:25.240 this
00:06:25.360 is
00:06:25.440 the
00:06:25.599 last
00:06:25.840 layer
00:06:26.160 just
00:06:26.360 before
00:06:26.680 the
00:06:26.880 head
00:06:27.720 and
00:06:27.960 as
00:06:28.080 you
00:06:28.199 can
00:06:28.400 actually
00:06:28.680 see
00:06:28.960 here
00:06:31.560 in
00:06:31.759 every
00:06:32.280 layer
00:06:33.520 we
00:06:33.800 learn
00:06:34.759 effectively
00:06:35.400 a
00:06:35.720 collection
00:06:36.720 of
00:06:36.960 these
00:06:37.280 filters
00:06:38.280 that
00:06:38.440 it
00:06:38.639 will
00:06:40.319 decompose
00:06:42.000 the
00:06:42.199 input
00:06:42.599 image
00:06:43.120 the
00:06:43.199 input
00:06:43.759 the
00:06:43.880 input
00:06:44.400 feature
00:06:44.720 maps
00:06:45.000 are
00:06:45.160 being
00:06:45.400 decomposed
00:06:46.039 so
00:06:46.280 if
00:06:46.360 you
00:06:46.520 go
00:06:46.759 back
00:06:46.960 to
00:06:47.680 what
00:06:47.840 we
00:06:48.000 have
00:06:48.199 discussed
00:06:48.639 earlier
00:06:49.080 about
00:06:49.360 the
00:06:49.919 operation
00:06:50.919 of
00:06:52.479 the
00:06:52.680 convolutional
00:06:53.400 kind
00:06:53.639 of
00:06:53.800 neuron
00:06:54.919 so
00:06:55.120 imagine
00:06:55.440 that
00:06:55.599 you
00:06:55.759 have
00:06:55.960 now
00:06:56.199 not
00:06:56.360 only
00:06:56.639 just
00:06:56.879 one
00:06:57.120 filter
00:06:57.599 but
00:06:57.720 you
00:06:57.879 have
00:06:58.039 let's
00:06:58.199 say
00:06:58.400 64
00:06:58.960 of
00:06:59.120 them
00:07:00.879 so
00:07:01.879 the
00:07:02.599 each
00:07:02.879 one
00:07:03.080 of
00:07:03.360 those
00:07:03.879 filters
00:07:04.840 is
00:07:05.120 one
00:07:05.520 component
00:07:06.280 out
00:07:06.560 of
00:07:06.879 the
00:07:07.160 let's
00:07:07.360 say
00:07:07.879 64
00:07:08.879 that
00:07:09.080 the
00:07:09.319 input
00:07:09.759 feature
00:07:10.199 map
00:07:10.520 will
00:07:10.680 be
00:07:10.879 DEC
00:07:11.120 composed
00:07:11.520 so
00:07:11.680 you
00:07:11.759 can
00:07:11.919 read
00:07:12.240 about
00:07:12.720 this
00:07:13.560 as
00:07:14.080 those
00:07:14.440 are
00:07:14.840 the
00:07:16.080 components
00:07:16.759 of
00:07:16.960 that
00:07:17.400 decomposition
00:07:18.400 so
00:07:18.680 this
00:07:19.879 so
00:07:20.080 in
00:07:20.199 the
00:07:20.400 last
00:07:21.000 kind
00:07:21.160 of
00:07:21.319 layer
00:07:21.639 over
00:07:21.879 here
00:07:22.080 we
00:07:22.240 have
00:07:22.440 64
00:07:23.680 components
00:07:25.000 for
00:07:25.240 those
00:07:25.440 who
00:07:25.680 have
00:07:26.280 some
00:07:26.560 background
00:07:26.960 on
00:07:27.160 principal
00:07:27.680 component
00:07:28.160 analysis
00:07:28.720 there's
00:07:29.000 some
00:07:29.879 something
00:07:30.319 to
00:07:30.520 it
00:07:31.080 along
00:07:31.440 those
00:07:31.680 lines
00:07:32.919 but
00:07:33.479 the
00:07:34.560 composition
00:07:35.080 over
00:07:35.360 here
00:07:35.599 is
00:07:37.160 definitely
00:07:38.520 exactly
00:07:38.919 the
00:07:39.080 same
00:07:39.479 as
00:07:39.639 any
00:07:39.879 other
00:07:40.120 decomposition
00:07:40.759 it's
00:07:40.879 just
00:07:41.039 that
00:07:41.240 these
00:07:41.560 components
00:07:42.319 as
00:07:42.520 the
00:07:42.879 layers
00:07:43.240 are
00:07:43.680 becoming
00:07:44.680 deeper
00:07:45.039 and
00:07:45.199 deeper
00:07:46.120 are
00:07:47.039 these
00:07:47.240 components
00:07:47.720 are
00:07:49.520 you
00:07:49.599 know
00:07:49.759 look
00:07:50.080 quite
00:07:50.560 different
00:07:51.560 and
00:07:52.120 this
00:07:52.360 as
00:07:52.479 you
00:07:52.599 can
00:07:52.720 see
00:07:53.000 here
00:07:53.720 the
00:07:53.800 filters
00:07:54.199 are
00:07:54.840 simpler
00:07:55.840 in
00:07:56.000 the
00:07:56.599 first
00:07:57.919 layers
00:07:59.000 and
00:07:59.159 become
00:08:00.000 more
00:08:00.199 and
00:08:00.400 more
00:08:01.440 complicated
00:08:02.599 in
00:08:02.800 the
00:08:03.159 subsequent
00:08:03.759 kind
00:08:03.960 of
00:08:04.080 layers
00:08:04.440 to

00:08:10.400 visual
00:08:11.599 intuitively
00:08:12.599 visual
