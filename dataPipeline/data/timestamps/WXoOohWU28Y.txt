00:00:00.120 to
00:00:00.240 start
00:00:00.799 understanding
00:00:01.160 what
00:00:01.400 is
00:00:01.640 really
00:00:02.000 the
00:00:02.840 fundamental
00:00:03.480 operation
00:00:04.040 happen
00:00:04.400 inside
00:00:04.759 those
00:00:05.200 convolutional
00:00:05.799 neuron
00:00:06.080 networks
00:00:06.759 let
00:00:06.919 me
00:00:07.160 just
00:00:07.520 start
00:00:07.839 with
00:00:08.200 a
00:00:08.599 simple
00:00:09.200 problem
00:00:10.200 and
00:00:10.360 this
00:00:10.559 problem
00:00:10.880 goes
00:00:11.160 as
00:00:11.320 follows
00:00:12.200 I
00:00:12.360 have
00:00:12.759 somewhere
00:00:13.200 in
00:00:13.360 this
00:00:13.599 kind
00:00:13.759 of
00:00:13.960 time
00:00:14.519 axis
00:00:15.519 a
00:00:16.240 signal
00:00:17.600 this
00:00:17.760 is
00:00:18.439 the
00:00:18.600 duration
00:00:19.000 of
00:00:19.160 this
00:00:19.359 signal
00:00:19.800 and
00:00:20.039 the
00:00:20.199 shape
00:00:20.480 of
00:00:20.600 the
00:00:20.760 signal
00:00:21.039 is
00:00:21.119 not
00:00:21.320 really
00:00:21.560 important
00:00:22.000 but
00:00:22.320 what
00:00:22.439 is
00:00:22.560 really
00:00:22.840 important
00:00:23.199 is
00:00:23.320 the
00:00:23.519 assumption
00:00:23.920 that
00:00:24.119 I
00:00:24.240 do
00:00:24.400 know
00:00:24.599 the
00:00:24.720 shape
00:00:25.039 of
00:00:25.199 that
00:00:25.760 signal
00:00:26.760 and
00:00:27.119 let's
00:00:27.359 assume
00:00:27.640 that
00:00:27.800 I
00:00:28.000 have
00:00:28.519 let's
00:00:28.679 say
00:00:28.880 call
00:00:29.199 this
00:00:29.359 signal
00:00:29.800 this
00:00:30.039 signal
00:00:30.439 X
00:00:30.920 oft
00:00:31.920 and
00:00:32.160 ask
00:00:32.360 you
00:00:32.520 the
00:00:33.160 question
00:00:34.000 as
00:00:34.160 to
00:00:34.600 can
00:00:34.760 we
00:00:34.960 come
00:00:35.280 up
00:00:35.480 with
00:00:35.600 a
00:00:35.760 method
00:00:36.160 that
00:00:36.360 we
00:00:36.480 can
00:00:36.960 sort
00:00:37.160 of
00:00:37.640 provide
00:00:38.760 the
00:00:38.960 location
00:00:39.640 of
00:00:39.960 that
00:00:40.920 signal
00:00:41.440 where
00:00:41.680 about
00:00:42.000 in
00:00:42.239 this
00:00:43.360 buffer
00:00:44.000 let's
00:00:44.280 say
00:00:45.280 U
00:00:46.160 of
00:00:46.520 the
00:00:46.640 signal
00:00:46.960 is
00:00:47.120 located
00:00:47.840 okay
00:00:48.360 so
00:00:49.360 a
00:00:49.559 simple
00:00:50.320 kind
00:00:50.480 of
00:00:50.719 approach
00:00:51.120 that
00:00:51.280 we
00:00:51.440 can
00:00:51.960 think
00:00:52.239 of
00:00:53.079 is
00:00:53.359 the
00:00:53.520 following
00:00:55.239 since
00:00:55.520 we
00:00:55.680 know
00:00:55.960 the
00:00:56.199 shape
00:00:56.520 of
00:00:56.719 this
00:00:57.120 kind
00:00:57.320 of
00:00:57.480 signal
00:00:57.879 I
00:00:58.039 can
00:00:58.239 actually
00:00:58.559 start
00:00:59.079 at
00:00:59.239 the
00:00:59.399 beginning
00:01:00.039 of
00:01:00.280 this
00:01:01.480 buffer
00:01:02.480 at
00:01:02.680 this
00:01:03.079 location
00:01:03.519 let
00:01:03.719 say
00:01:04.040 zero
00:01:05.040 and
00:01:05.439 for
00:01:05.760 every
00:01:07.600 position
00:01:08.040 if
00:01:08.159 you
00:01:08.320 like
00:01:09.920 the
00:01:11.040 hypothesis
00:01:12.040 the
00:01:12.400 you
00:01:12.520 know
00:01:12.720 that
00:01:12.840 the
00:01:12.960 buffer
00:01:13.320 is
00:01:13.759 the
00:01:13.920 signal
00:01:14.200 is
00:01:14.320 located
00:01:14.640 at
00:01:14.720 this
00:01:14.920 specific
00:01:15.960 point
00:01:16.759 and
00:01:16.920 start
00:01:17.320 making
00:01:18.080 an
00:01:18.320 operation
00:01:18.960 that
00:01:19.159 will
00:01:20.520 effectively
00:01:21.000 means
00:01:22.159 taking
00:01:22.439 the
00:01:22.640 dot
00:01:22.920 product
00:01:23.479 between
00:01:23.840 the
00:01:24.079 contents
00:01:24.600 of
00:01:24.880 that
00:01:25.840 buffer
00:01:26.400 and
00:01:26.640 that
00:01:27.720 signal
00:01:28.720 and
00:01:30.040 this
00:01:30.159 means
00:01:30.360 that
00:01:30.640 multiplying
00:01:31.640 every
00:01:31.960 element
00:01:32.399 of
00:01:32.600 this
00:01:33.079 buffer
00:01:33.600 with
00:01:33.880 the
00:01:34.360 amplitude
00:01:35.240 let's
00:01:35.479 say
00:01:35.840 the
00:01:36.000 amplitude
00:01:36.479 was
00:01:36.720 one
00:01:37.560 of
00:01:37.759 the
00:01:38.000 signal
00:01:38.360 and
00:01:38.600 summing
00:01:39.079 over
00:01:39.479 all
00:01:39.640 of
00:01:39.840 the
00:01:40.439 elements
00:01:41.439 and
00:01:41.799 so
00:01:42.000 if
00:01:42.079 we
00:01:42.280 do
00:01:42.479 that
00:01:42.720 then
00:01:42.880 it's
00:01:43.040 a
00:01:43.240 whole
00:01:43.479 bunch
00:01:43.720 of
00:01:43.920 zeros
00:01:44.399 time
00:01:44.799 one
00:01:45.799 then
00:01:46.159 we
00:01:46.280 will
00:01:46.479 be
00:01:46.680 getting
00:01:46.960 a
00:01:47.479 result
00:01:48.680 that
00:01:48.840 it
00:01:49.000 will
00:01:49.840 be
00:01:50.840 zero
00:01:51.759 evidently
00:01:52.759 okay
00:01:52.920 so
00:01:53.159 that
00:01:53.320 is
00:01:53.600 we
00:01:54.320 the
00:01:54.520 zero
00:01:54.920 and
00:01:55.119 we'll
00:01:55.320 be
00:01:55.479 getting
00:01:55.759 in
00:01:55.960 fact
00:01:56.680 all
00:01:57.600 zeros
00:01:58.600 results
00:01:59.520 up
00:01:59.920 to
00:02:00.079 the
00:02:00.799 point
00:02:01.799 where
00:02:02.079 we
00:02:02.880 start
00:02:04.000 having
00:02:05.360 my
00:02:06.600 hypo
00:02:07.000 hypothetical
00:02:07.680 kind
00:02:07.920 of
00:02:08.119 a
00:02:08.360 signal
00:02:09.520 be
00:02:10.039 right
00:02:10.280 at
00:02:10.840 the
00:02:12.080 location
00:02:13.040 of
00:02:13.440 that
00:02:14.840 true
00:02:15.160 location
00:02:15.560 of
00:02:15.720 that
00:02:16.000 kind
00:02:16.120 of
00:02:16.280 signal
00:02:16.800 so
00:02:17.959 after
00:02:18.319 this
00:02:18.519 point
00:02:18.840 as
00:02:18.959 you
00:02:19.080 can
00:02:19.599 understand
00:02:20.200 we
00:02:20.400 going
00:02:20.519 to
00:02:20.879 have
00:02:21.879 some
00:02:22.239 overlap
00:02:22.840 between
00:02:23.200 this
00:02:23.400 signal
00:02:23.760 and
00:02:24.080 this
00:02:24.720 so
00:02:24.959 we
00:02:25.319 be
00:02:25.599 starting
00:02:26.280 getting
00:02:27.280 some
00:02:27.640 nonzero
00:02:28.640 results
00:02:29.120 out
00:02:29.280 of
00:02:29.440 this
00:02:29.920 of
00:02:30.360 operation
00:02:31.360 and
00:02:31.640 right
00:02:31.959 where
00:02:32.599 exactly
00:02:33.440 the
00:02:34.360 signal
00:02:34.800 is
00:02:35.239 located
00:02:36.239 right
00:02:36.440 under
00:02:36.800 it
00:02:38.120 then
00:02:38.519 we
00:02:38.640 will
00:02:39.440 start
00:02:39.840 getting
00:02:40.120 a
00:02:40.280 pick
00:02:41.280 and
00:02:41.440 then
00:02:42.000 evidently
00:02:45.200 we'll
00:02:46.200 start
00:02:47.040 you
00:02:47.200 know
00:02:47.400 going
00:02:47.720 back
00:02:47.920 to
00:02:48.159 zero
00:02:49.159 and
00:02:49.319 so
00:02:49.519 on
00:02:49.680 and
00:02:49.840 so
00:02:50.000 on
00:02:50.200 so
00:02:50.480 this
00:02:50.599 is
00:02:50.920 basically
00:02:51.920 an
00:02:52.200 approach
00:02:52.840 if
00:02:52.959 we
00:02:53.159 take
00:02:53.440 the
00:02:53.599 AR
00:02:53.959 Marx
00:02:54.239 of
00:02:54.440 what
00:02:54.599 this
00:02:54.840 kind
00:02:54.959 of
00:02:55.280 operation
00:02:56.280 this
00:02:56.440 will
00:02:56.680 be
00:02:57.040 let's
00:02:57.280 say
00:02:57.640 the
00:02:59.360 tow
00:02:59.959 the
00:03:00.159 location
00:03:01.040 that
00:03:01.319 sort
00:03:01.560 of
00:03:01.760 indicates
00:03:02.519 the
00:03:03.440 sort
00:03:03.680 of
00:03:04.879 that
00:03:05.000 we
00:03:05.159 have
00:03:05.360 predicted
00:03:06.239 as
00:03:06.360 far
00:03:06.560 as
00:03:06.720 this
00:03:07.000 kind
00:03:07.120 of
00:03:07.239 signal
00:03:07.560 is
00:03:09.239 concerned
00:03:10.239 so
00:03:10.480 what
00:03:10.640 we
00:03:10.879 just
00:03:11.120 did
00:03:11.920 is
00:03:12.200 an
00:03:12.440 example
00:03:12.840 of
00:03:13.000 what
00:03:13.159 we
00:03:13.319 call
00:03:13.519 a
00:03:13.760 onedimensional
00:03:14.319 correlation
00:03:15.319 operation
00:03:15.959 cross
00:03:16.239 correlation
00:03:16.760 operation
00:03:17.400 because
00:03:17.680 we
00:03:17.799 are
00:03:18.000 trying
00:03:18.239 to
00:03:18.400 correlate
00:03:19.400 a
00:03:19.879 hypothetical
00:03:21.120 signal
00:03:22.480 located
00:03:22.959 in
00:03:23.200 this
00:03:23.599 hypoth
00:03:24.239 over
00:03:24.560 here
00:03:25.239 against
00:03:25.840 some
00:03:26.200 other
00:03:26.519 signal
00:03:27.040 the
00:03:27.280 X
00:03:27.480 oft
00:03:28.239 so
00:03:28.560 I
00:03:28.760 will
00:03:29.000 actually
00:03:29.280 call
00:03:30.080 this
00:03:30.680 simplistically
00:03:31.680 let's
00:03:31.879 say
00:03:32.400 y
00:03:32.680 of
00:03:32.840 T
00:03:33.760 I'm
00:03:33.959 actually
00:03:34.280 correlating
00:03:35.040 X
00:03:35.280 of
00:03:35.480 T
00:03:35.680 and
00:03:35.920 Y
00:03:36.400 of
00:03:36.599 T
00:03:37.120 and
00:03:37.879 this
00:03:38.040 kind
00:03:38.159 of
00:03:38.480 correlation
00:03:39.480 operation
00:03:40.080 is
00:03:40.360 able
00:03:40.680 to
00:03:40.879 retrieve
00:03:41.480 for
00:03:41.720 me
00:03:42.280 in
00:03:42.480 this
00:03:42.680 simple

00:05:29.360 now
00:05:29.759 where
00:05:29.919 we
00:05:30.160 have
00:05:30.800 we
00:05:30.919 are
00:05:31.080 going
00:05:31.319 back
00:05:31.479 to

00:05:33.240 image
00:05:33.960 and
00:05:34.120 let
00:05:34.280 me
00:05:34.560 just
00:05:35.520 write
00:05:35.880 over
00:05:36.199 here
00:05:36.440 if
00:05:36.680 I
00:05:37.680 kind
00:05:37.840 of
00:05:38.039 try
00:05:38.240 to
00:05:38.440 squeeze
00:05:38.880 it
00:05:39.880 so
00:05:40.120 this
00:05:40.240 is
00:05:40.400 our
00:05:41.600 image
00:05:42.600 that
00:05:42.800 we
00:05:42.919 have
00:05:43.080 seen
00:05:43.440 earlier
00:05:44.440 with

00:05:44.880 Yellow
00:05:45.240 Cab
00:05:45.479 in
00:05:45.600 the
00:05:46.479 middle
00:05:47.479 and
00:05:48.680 here
00:05:48.880 I
00:05:49.080 have
00:05:50.000 right
00:05:50.199 in
00:05:50.319 the
00:05:50.479 middle
00:05:51.080 a
00:05:51.759 kind
00:05:52.000 of
00:05:52.240 a
00:05:54.319 taxi
00:05:55.319 Okay
00:05:55.840 so
00:06:00.400 all
00:06:00.639 right
00:06:01.520 and
00:06:01.759 I
00:06:01.919 ask
00:06:02.120 you
00:06:02.319 exactly
00:06:02.720 the
00:06:02.880 same
00:06:03.160 question
00:06:04.120 how
00:06:04.319 we
00:06:04.479 can
00:06:05.400 potentially
00:06:07.360 detect
00:06:08.639 this
00:06:09.199 kind
00:06:09.360 of
00:06:10.919 Taxi
00:06:12.039 in
00:06:12.280 this
00:06:12.479 kind
00:06:12.639 of
00:06:12.800 image
00:06:13.479 okay
00:06:14.120 all
00:06:14.319 right
00:06:15.520 and
00:06:16.360 maybe
00:06:16.759 the
00:06:20.080 I
00:06:20.160 mean
00:06:20.400 if
00:06:20.560 we
00:06:21.000 have
00:06:21.319 known
00:06:22.319 the
00:06:22.639 exact
00:06:23.120 shape
00:06:23.599 of
00:06:23.919 this
00:06:25.440 object
00:06:26.960 like
00:06:27.160 we
00:06:27.319 have
00:06:27.520 assumed
00:06:27.919 earlier
00:06:29.039 then
00:06:29.199 the
00:06:29.560 operation
00:06:30.160 actually
00:06:30.479 would
00:06:30.680 be
00:06:32.120 straightforward
00:06:33.120 we'll
00:06:33.440 take
00:06:33.840 this
00:06:34.639 template
00:06:35.240 again
00:06:36.360 we'll
00:06:36.599 call
00:06:36.800 it
00:06:38.360 y
00:06:38.919 now
00:06:39.880 and
00:06:40.199 we
00:06:40.319 will
00:06:40.759 start
00:06:41.759 sliding
00:06:42.919 this
00:06:43.120 kind
00:06:43.280 of
00:06:43.479 template
00:06:44.000 across
00:06:44.400 this
00:06:44.599 kind
00:06:44.759 of
00:06:44.960 image
00:06:45.280 to
00:06:45.560 be
00:06:45.680 able
00:06:46.120 to
00:06:47.120 at
00:06:47.280 some
00:06:47.520 point
00:06:47.720 where
00:06:47.919 the
00:06:48.080 template
00:06:48.479 is
00:06:49.120 exactly
00:06:50.840 present
00:06:51.479 right
00:06:51.680 on
00:06:51.880 top
00:06:52.120 of
00:06:52.360 that
00:06:52.919 U
00:06:53.599 object
00:06:53.960 in
00:06:54.199 the
00:06:54.520 in
00:06:54.680 the
00:06:54.960 image
00:06:55.840 X
00:06:56.840 we
00:06:56.960 will
00:06:57.520 then
00:06:58.319 declare
00:06:58.759 that
00:06:58.919 that's
00:06:59.120 basically
00:06:59.720 the
00:07:00.199 location
00:07:00.759 of
00:07:01.000 that
00:07:01.440 of
00:07:01.879 that
00:07:02.199 object
00:07:03.400 the
00:07:03.599 problem
00:07:04.479 however
00:07:04.759 is
00:07:05.000 that
00:07:05.360 in
00:07:05.800 this
00:07:05.960 kind
00:07:06.120 of
00:07:06.360 approach
00:07:06.919 we
00:07:07.199 have
00:07:07.759 first
00:07:08.120 assume
00:07:08.560 that
00:07:08.720 we
00:07:08.879 will
00:07:09.240 know
00:07:10.240 exactly
00:07:10.720 the
00:07:10.879 shape
00:07:11.199 of
00:07:11.479 that
00:07:12.240 object
00:07:12.800 which
00:07:12.960 is
00:07:13.240 not
00:07:13.720 realistic
00:07:14.720 because
00:07:15.720 the
00:07:15.919 object
00:07:16.319 is
00:07:17.400 definitely
00:07:18.319 going
00:07:18.599 to
00:07:19.319 vary
00:07:20.120 quite
00:07:20.319 a
00:07:20.639 lot
00:07:21.039 let's
00:07:21.240 say
00:07:21.440 the
00:07:21.560 object
00:07:22.000 may
00:07:22.160 be
00:07:22.319 rotated
00:07:23.160 translated
00:07:24.000 in
00:07:25.520 sort
00:07:25.759 of
00:07:26.879 or
00:07:28.240 being
00:07:28.800 sort
00:07:29.000 of
00:07:29.800 because
00:07:30.039 of
00:07:30.160 the
00:07:30.280 lighting
00:07:30.879 condition
00:07:31.120 maybe
00:07:31.560 not
00:07:32.400 sort
00:07:32.599 of
00:07:33.080 very
00:07:33.360 evident
00:07:33.759 it's
00:07:34.680 exact
00:07:35.000 shape
00:07:35.800 it's
00:07:36.000 shadowed
00:07:36.599 for
00:07:36.800 example
00:07:37.160 or

00:07:38.319 by
00:07:38.560 other
00:07:38.879 objects
00:07:39.759 and
00:07:39.919 the
00:07:40.080 other
00:07:41.479 assumption
00:07:42.080 is
00:07:42.280 that

00:07:47.440 prototype
00:07:48.199 is
00:07:48.440 in

00:07:48.840 of
00:07:49.000 number
00:07:49.280 of

00:07:49.840 the
00:07:49.960 more
00:07:50.199 expensive
00:07:50.759 this
00:07:50.919 kind
00:07:51.080 of
00:07:51.240 operation
00:07:51.840 becomes
00:07:52.520 so
00:07:52.680 in
00:07:52.800 order
00:07:53.080 to
00:07:53.479 solve
00:07:53.879 these
00:07:54.280 two
00:07:54.680 problems
00:07:55.840 what
00:07:56.000 we
00:07:56.159 will
00:07:56.400 do
00:07:57.159 what
00:07:57.319 we
00:07:57.440 would
00:07:57.800 suggest
00:07:58.800 is
00:07:59.879 we
00:08:00.000 will
00:08:00.199 not
00:08:00.520 abandon
00:08:01.120 this
00:08:01.319 kind
00:08:01.479 of
00:08:01.639 sliding
00:08:02.319 operation
00:08:03.759 that
00:08:03.960 we
00:08:04.120 will
00:08:04.360 called
00:08:04.919 cross
00:08:05.240 correlation
00:08:05.720 a
00:08:05.840 bit
00:08:06.039 earlier
00:08:06.560 but
00:08:06.759 if
00:08:07.080 in
00:08:07.240 fact
00:08:07.919 what
00:08:08.080 we
00:08:08.199 will
00:08:08.440 actually
00:08:08.759 do
00:08:09.000 now
00:08:09.199 is
00:08:09.360 we'll
00:08:09.639 use
00:08:09.919 a
00:08:10.159 much
00:08:10.639 smaller
00:08:11.960 prototype
00:08:12.960 and
00:08:13.440 we
00:08:13.759 are
00:08:14.759 now
00:08:15.000 pH
00:08:15.319 the
00:08:15.560 problem
00:08:15.919 as
00:08:16.039 to
00:08:16.280 what
00:08:16.440 is
00:08:16.720 really
00:08:17.039 the
00:08:17.240 contents
00:08:17.639 of
00:08:17.840 that
00:08:18.520 sort
00:08:18.759 of
00:08:18.919 prototype
00:08:19.440 that
00:08:19.560 we
00:08:19.680 will
00:08:19.879 be
00:08:20.360 calling
00:08:20.720 from
00:08:20.960 now
00:08:21.199 on
00:08:21.440 a
00:08:21.599 kernel
00:08:22.520 so
00:08:22.680 let
00:08:22.800 me
00:08:23.000 just
00:08:23.159 draw
00:08:23.680 the
00:08:24.000 kernel
00:08:24.479 over
00:08:24.759 here
00:08:25.759 and
00:08:25.960 maybe
00:08:26.240 I
00:08:26.360 can
00:08:26.599 start
00:08:27.400 answering
00:08:27.919 the
00:08:28.120 question
00:08:28.440 as
00:08:28.599 to
00:08:28.800 what
00:08:28.919 should
00:08:29.159 be
00:08:29.319 the
00:08:29.639 contents
00:08:30.039 of
00:08:30.280 this
00:08:30.560 kernel
00:08:31.560 that
00:08:31.680 will
00:08:31.919 be
00:08:32.080 able
00:08:32.360 to
00:08:33.000 detect
00:08:33.479 this
00:08:34.880 cab
00:08:35.200 over
00:08:35.479 here
00:08:35.959 all
00:08:36.080 right
00:08:36.719 so
00:08:37.880 this
00:08:38.039 image
00:08:38.279 is
00:08:38.440 extremely
00:08:38.880 simple
00:08:39.320 in
00:08:39.479 fact
00:08:39.680 it
00:08:39.880 has
00:08:40.839 zeros
00:08:41.560 in
00:08:42.159 these
00:08:42.839 pixels
00:08:43.839 and
00:08:45.080 all
00:08:45.480 the
00:08:45.680 other
00:08:45.920 pixels
00:08:46.360 which
00:08:46.519 we
00:08:46.640 have
00:08:46.800 not
00:08:46.959 drawn
00:08:47.320 anything
00:08:47.680 are
00:08:48.160 255
00:08:49.080 so
00:08:49.320 255
00:08:50.040 corresponds
00:08:50.600 to
00:08:50.880 Pure
00:08:51.200 White
00:08:52.120 and
00:08:52.279 zero
00:08:52.640 corresponds
00:08:53.160 to
00:08:53.320 Black
00:08:53.880 so
00:08:54.120 since
00:08:54.320 I
00:08:54.480 have
00:08:54.600 a
00:08:54.720 black
00:08:54.920 and
00:08:55.160 white
00:08:55.399 image
00:08:56.399 I
00:08:56.560 can
00:08:58.240 suggest
00:08:58.839 that
00:08:59.560 maybe
00:09:00.760 if
00:09:00.959 I
00:09:01.200 can
00:09:02.680 U
00:09:04.800 have
00:09:04.959 a
00:09:05.160 Kel
00:09:07.360 who's
00:09:09.120 pixels
00:09:10.120 so
00:09:10.360 this
00:09:10.480 is
00:09:10.880 a
00:09:11.040 kernel
00:09:11.560 which
00:09:11.720 is
00:09:12.399 the
00:09:12.560 size
00:09:12.800 of
00:09:13.000 that
00:09:13.200 is
00:09:13.320 not
00:09:13.600 necessarily
00:09:14.160 accidental
00:09:14.920 it's
00:09:15.440 3x3
00:09:16.240 in
00:09:16.440 this
00:09:17.880 case
00:09:19.040 and
00:09:19.240 if
00:09:19.440 I
00:09:21.200 Locate
00:09:21.680 over
00:09:22.000 here
00:09:22.320 in
00:09:22.519 this
00:09:22.959 pixels
00:09:23.440 I
00:09:23.560 made
00:09:23.760 them
00:09:23.959 let's
00:09:24.120 say
00:09:24.320 zeros
00:09:24.680 and
00:09:24.880 over
00:09:25.079 here
00:09:25.279 I
00:09:25.399 made
00:09:25.600 them
00:09:26.200 255
00:09:27.200 then
00:09:27.320 you
00:09:27.440 can
00:09:27.600 all
00:09:28.040 understand
00:09:28.160 that
00:09:28.320 as
00:09:28.480 I'm
00:09:28.680 sliding
00:09:29.120 around
00:09:29.600 this
00:09:29.959 kind
00:09:30.120 of
00:09:30.320 Kernel
00:09:31.279 I
00:09:31.360 will
00:09:31.880 definitely
00:09:32.680 go
00:09:33.160 and
00:09:33.880 at
00:09:34.040 some
00:09:34.279 point
00:09:34.600 hit
00:09:34.880 this
00:09:35.120 location
00:09:35.600 over
00:09:39.160 here
00:09:40.160 with
00:09:40.360 this
00:09:40.560 kernel
00:09:41.360 and
00:09:41.600 at
00:09:42.200 that
00:09:42.360 moment
00:09:42.720 in
00:09:42.959 that
00:09:43.519 location
00:09:44.519 then
00:09:44.720 I
00:09:44.839 will
00:09:45.040 be
00:09:45.560 getting
00:09:46.000 some
00:09:47.920 definitely
00:09:50.160 significant
00:09:51.360 Peak
00:09:52.120 if
00:09:52.240 I
00:09:52.360 may
00:09:52.600 call
00:09:52.760 it
00:09:52.920 like
00:09:53.120 that
00:09:53.360 out
00:09:53.519 of
00:09:53.720 my
00:09:53.959 crosscorrelation
00:09:54.839 operation
00:09:55.279 so
00:09:55.440 we'll
00:09:55.600 see
00:09:55.760 the
00:09:55.880 details
00:09:56.200 the
00:09:56.399 mathematical
00:09:56.880 details
00:09:57.200 of
00:09:57.320 that
00:09:57.800 cross
00:09:58.079 correlation
00:09:58.560 operation
00:09:59.640 shortly
00:10:00.399 but
00:10:00.560 that's
00:10:00.839 basically
00:10:01.399 what
00:10:01.600 is
00:10:02.440 going
00:10:02.560 to
00:10:02.800 happen
00:10:03.320 then
00:10:04.320 and
00:10:04.680 so
00:10:05.040 exactly
00:10:05.399 the
00:10:05.519 same
00:10:06.079 thing
00:10:06.240 will
00:10:06.839 actually
00:10:07.120 happen
00:10:07.440 in
00:10:07.560 this
00:10:07.760 location
00:10:08.760 and
00:10:09.000 potentially
00:10:09.519 in
00:10:09.720 this
00:10:10.160 type
00:10:10.320 of
00:10:10.480 locations
00:10:11.040 and
00:10:11.200 so
00:10:11.560 on
00:10:12.839 but
00:10:13.360 I
00:10:13.440 don't
00:10:13.640 think
00:10:13.800 that
00:10:14.040 we
00:10:14.600 have
00:10:15.079 the
00:10:15.480 complete
00:10:15.839 story
00:10:16.279 yet
00:10:16.640 because
00:10:17.680 I
00:10:17.800 can
00:10:18.040 suggest
00:10:18.440 an
00:10:18.640 additional
00:10:19.160 kind
00:10:19.320 of
00:10:22.000 Kernel
00:10:23.000 again
00:10:23.200 it
00:10:23.399 will
00:10:23.560 be
00:10:24.360 3x3
00:10:25.360 and
00:10:25.519 this
00:10:25.720 kernel
00:10:26.160 if
00:10:26.279 it
00:10:26.440 is
00:10:28.760 sort
00:10:29.000 of
00:10:31.480 programmed
00:10:32.160 to
00:10:32.480 contain
00:10:33.160 this
00:10:34.160 type
00:10:34.440 of
00:10:35.320 information
00:10:37.399 where
00:10:37.639 now
00:10:37.959 the
00:10:38.240 black
00:10:39.399 pixels
00:10:39.760 are
00:10:40.000 like
00:10:40.240 this
00:10:40.440 and
00:10:40.600 the
00:10:40.800 whites
00:10:41.160 are
00:10:41.800 over
00:10:42.120 there
00:10:42.360 they're
00:10:42.600 kind
00:10:42.760 of
00:10:42.880 a
00:10:43.399 diagonally
00:10:44.560 then
00:10:44.760 we
00:10:44.880 will
00:10:45.079 be
00:10:45.320 able
00:10:45.560 to
00:10:45.760 pick
00:10:45.959 up
00:10:46.320 probably
00:10:47.480 this
00:10:48.480 feature
00:10:48.920 over
00:10:49.240 here
00:10:49.959 where
00:10:50.240 the
00:10:50.399 wind
00:10:50.680 screen
00:10:51.320 is
00:10:53.279 and
00:10:53.440 so
00:10:53.600 on
00:10:53.760 and
00:10:53.880 so
00:10:54.040 on
00:10:54.240 so
00:10:54.399 we
00:10:54.519 can
00:10:54.720 actually
00:10:57.240 suggest
00:10:57.800 other
00:10:58.120 kernels
00:10:58.680 as
00:10:58.839 well
00:10:59.399 where
00:11:00.000 we
00:11:00.200 now
00:11:00.560 have
00:11:01.000 the
00:11:02.160 other
00:11:03.720 diagonal
00:11:05.040 these
00:11:05.240 wheels
00:11:05.760 can
00:11:06.000 be
00:11:06.320 detected
00:11:06.880 by
00:11:07.120 having
00:11:08.480 some
00:11:08.880 something
00:11:09.519 else
00:11:10.440 some
00:11:10.639 other
00:11:10.920 kind
00:11:11.079 of
00:11:14.040 Kernel
00:11:15.040 where
00:11:15.279 maybe
00:11:15.560 these
00:11:15.920 guys
00:11:16.240 will
00:11:16.480 be
00:11:17.480 need
00:11:17.680 to
00:11:17.839 be
00:11:19.440 sort
00:11:19.680 of

00:11:20.440 like
00:11:20.680 this
00:11:20.920 colored
00:11:21.279 in
00:11:21.519 quotes
00:11:22.160 or
00:11:22.440 program
00:11:22.880 like
00:11:23.079 this
00:11:23.320 with
00:11:23.560 255
00:11:24.240 and
00:11:24.839 zeros
00:11:26.040 and
00:11:26.320 as
00:11:26.440 you
00:11:26.560 can
00:11:27.240 understand
00:11:28.240 all
00:11:28.440 of
00:11:28.680 these

00:11:36.480 and
00:11:36.720 I'll
00:11:36.959 be
00:11:37.120 calling
00:11:37.560 now
00:11:37.760 from
00:11:38.040 now
00:11:38.279 on
00:11:39.160 this
00:11:40.160 aggregation
00:11:40.920 of
00:11:41.160 kernels
00:11:41.800 as
00:11:42.000 a
00:11:44.440 filter
00:11:45.440 so
00:11:45.720 filter
00:11:46.120 for
00:11:46.320 me
00:11:46.600 will
00:11:46.839 be
00:11:47.800 this
00:11:48.040 kind
00:11:48.240 of
00:11:48.440 a
00:11:49.000 three-dimensional
00:11:51.079 structure
00:11:52.079 that
00:11:52.279 it
00:11:52.480 will
00:11:55.320 have
00:11:56.320 3x3
00:11:57.200 let's
00:11:57.440 say
00:11:58.079 spatial
00:11:58.600 coordinates
00:12:00.079 so
00:12:00.360 this
00:12:00.519 is
00:12:00.760 the
00:12:05.519 spatial
00:12:06.720 let
00:12:06.839 me
00:12:07.000 call
00:12:07.160 it
00:12:09.519 extent
00:12:10.519 and
00:12:10.839 it
00:12:11.000 would
00:12:11.320 have
00:12:11.560 some
00:12:11.839 kind
00:12:12.040 of
00:12:12.160 a
00:12:12.399 depth
00:12:13.639 D
00:12:14.639 and
00:12:14.880 this
00:12:15.440 depth
00:12:16.240 let's
00:12:16.720 write
00:12:17.720 depth
00:12:18.360 is
00:12:18.600 of
00:12:18.760 course
00:12:19.639 the
00:12:19.800 number
00:12:20.079 of
00:12:20.480 Kels
00:12:21.000 that
00:12:21.199 I
00:12:21.399 employ
00:12:21.959 in
00:12:22.199 this
00:12:22.639 filter
00:12:23.639 okay
00:12:23.839 so
00:12:24.240 over
00:12:24.560 here
00:12:24.880 that
00:12:25.240 is
00:12:25.720 basically
00:12:27.040 a
00:12:27.560 structure
00:12:28.240 that
00:12:28.399 I
00:12:28.519 will
00:12:28.720 see
00:12:29.360 will
00:12:29.519 be
00:12:29.800 a
00:12:30.320 fairly
00:12:31.000 I
00:12:31.240 call
00:12:31.399 it
00:12:31.519 useful
00:12:32.240 for
00:12:32.440 me
00:12:33.279 to
00:12:33.440 be
00:12:33.600 able
00:12:33.839 to
00:12:34.120 detect
00:12:34.600 now
00:12:35.560 pixels
00:12:36.360 sorry
00:12:37.040 features
00:12:38.199 from
00:12:38.639 images
00:12:39.600 okay
00:12:39.880 and
00:12:40.079 now
00:12:40.360 let's
00:12:40.839 see
00:12:41.079 the
00:12:41.839 mathematical
00:12:43.760 description
00:12:44.519 of
00:12:44.800 what
00:12:45.000 we
00:12:45.279 have
00:12:45.600 just
00:12:46.760 described
00:12:48.120 let
00:12:48.279 me
00:12:48.480 go
00:12:48.680 back
00:12:48.839 to
00:12:49.040 the
00:12:49.800 site
00:12:50.800 and
00:12:51.000 in
00:12:51.240 that
00:12:51.720 site
00:12:52.160 we
00:12:52.360 have
00:12:53.320 the
00:12:53.440 so-called
00:12:54.120 two-dimensional
00:12:55.120 the
00:12:55.320 extension
00:12:55.720 of
00:12:55.880 the
00:12:56.040 so-called
00:12:56.440 two-
00:12:56.600 dimensional
00:12:57.079 crosscorrelation
00:12:58.120 operation
00:12:59.199 and
00:12:59.360 it's
00:12:59.560 ex
00:12:59.760 actually
00:13:00.079 shown
00:13:00.360 here
00:13:00.519 in
00:13:00.680 this
00:13:00.920 kind
00:13:01.120 of
00:13:01.480 image
00:13:02.800 this
00:13:03.240 in
00:13:03.360 this
00:13:03.560 picture
00:13:04.519 so
00:13:04.720 we
00:13:04.920 have
00:13:05.560 an
00:13:05.760 input
00:13:06.240 image
00:13:06.800 of
00:13:11.040 pixels
00:13:12.320 and
00:13:12.480 we
00:13:12.639 have
00:13:12.760 a
00:13:12.959 kernel
00:13:13.920 of
00:13:14.360 2x2
00:13:14.959 in
00:13:15.920 case
00:13:16.920 and
00:13:17.079 the
00:13:17.240 Kel
00:13:17.760 is
00:13:18.040 going
00:13:18.240 to
00:13:18.440 be
00:13:19.279 positioned
00:13:20.880 on
00:13:21.160 all
00:13:21.839 possible

00:13:23.000 in
00:13:23.360 this
00:13:24.079 image
00:13:24.920 in
00:13:25.079 this
00:13:25.279 input
00:13:25.680 image
00:13:25.959 so
00:13:26.160 in
00:13:26.320 this
00:13:26.519 specific
00:13:27.000 case
00:13:27.199 it
00:13:27.360 is
00:13:27.519 position
00:13:27.920 at
00:13:28.040 this
00:13:28.199 moment
00:13:28.440 in
00:13:28.639 time
00:13:29.839 this
00:13:30.040 location
00:13:30.560 over
00:13:30.880 here
00:13:31.720 and
00:13:31.920 we
00:13:32.040 are
00:13:32.160 going
00:13:32.279 to
00:13:32.440 be
00:13:32.560 forming
00:13:33.000 the

00:13:36.639 image
00:13:37.560 and
00:13:37.800 evidently
00:13:38.320 the
00:13:38.519 dot
00:13:38.800 product
00:13:39.199 is

00:13:46.440 and
00:13:46.720 that
00:13:46.880 will
00:13:47.160 actually
00:13:47.480 be
00:13:47.680 a
00:13:47.880 scalar
00:13:48.600 that
00:13:48.800 it
00:13:48.959 will
00:13:49.199 give
00:13:49.440 us
00:13:51.120 the

00:13:52.600 value
00:13:53.560 extracted
00:13:54.120 feature
00:13:54.600 value
00:13:55.000 out
00:13:55.199 of

00:13:56.720 operation
00:13:57.720 and
00:13:57.880 we
00:13:58.000 will
00:13:58.199 do
00:13:58.399 exactly
00:13:58.759 the
00:13:58.839 same
00:13:59.360 thing
00:13:59.680 over
00:13:59.880 and
00:14:00.120 over
00:14:00.639 again
00:14:01.279 we're
00:14:01.440 going
00:14:01.560 to
00:14:01.720 slide
00:14:02.040 the

00:14:04.560 bcfg
00:14:05.560 we'll
00:14:05.759 do
00:14:05.959 the

00:14:09.560 product
00:14:10.000 with
00:14:10.480 it
00:14:11.480 and
00:14:11.959 to
00:14:12.120 cut
00:14:12.320 a
00:14:12.440 long
00:14:12.680 story
00:14:13.000 short
00:14:13.880 we
00:14:14.040 are
00:14:14.160 going
00:14:14.320 to
00:14:14.440 be
00:14:14.639 getting

00:14:16.279 output
00:14:17.040 image
00:14:17.759 and
00:14:17.959 from
00:14:18.199 now
00:14:18.440 on
00:14:18.680 we'll
00:14:18.880 be
00:14:19.079 calling
00:14:19.519 this
00:14:20.240 output
00:14:21.320 images

00:14:23.680 images
00:14:24.240 feature
00:14:24.680 Maps
00:14:25.279 because
00:14:25.639 they
00:14:25.759 are
00:14:26.160 mapping
00:14:27.160 the
00:14:27.360 features
00:14:27.880 that
00:14:28.079 we
00:14:28.199 have
00:14:28.440 extracted
00:14:28.920 with
00:14:29.199 the
00:14:29.320 usage
00:14:29.720 of
00:14:30.440 kernels
00:14:31.240 here
00:14:31.399 we
00:14:31.560 see
00:14:31.839 just
00:14:32.000 a
00:14:32.199 single
00:14:32.680 kernel
00:14:33.680 but
00:14:33.800 in
00:14:33.959 general
00:14:34.279 we're
00:14:34.440 going
00:14:34.560 to
00:14:34.759 have
00:14:35.160 multiple
00:14:35.680 kernels
00:14:36.079 be
00:14:36.279 involved
00:14:36.759 in
00:14:36.880 the
00:14:37.120 shape
00:14:37.360 and
00:14:37.519 form
00:14:37.800 of

00:14:39.959 in
00:14:40.399 these
00:14:40.639 operations
00:14:41.320 and
00:14:41.720 so
00:14:42.000 basically
00:14:42.480 this
00:14:42.600 is
00:14:43.639 what
00:14:43.800 we
00:14:43.920 will
00:14:44.120 be
00:14:44.279 doing
00:14:44.560 from
00:14:44.759 now
00:14:45.000 on
00:14:45.480 and
00:14:46.440 we
00:14:46.600 will
00:14:46.839 be
00:14:47.600 sort
00:14:47.839 of
00:14:48.040 need
00:14:48.240 to
00:14:48.480 discuss
00:14:48.959 next
00:14:49.959 some
00:14:51.160 architectural
00:14:52.000 elements
00:14:52.560 of
00:14:53.519 you
00:14:53.639 know
00:14:53.959 this
00:14:54.360 that
00:14:54.680 are
00:14:55.160 sort
00:14:55.360 of
00:14:56.279 encompassing
00:14:57.079 this
00:14:57.920 operation
00:14:58.480 over
00:14:58.720 here
00:14:59.120 but
00:14:59.320 also
00:15:00.240 enhance
00:15:00.720 it
00:15:01.000 with
00:15:02.040 further
