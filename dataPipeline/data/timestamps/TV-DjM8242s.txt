00:00:01.040 so
00:00:01.280 this
00:00:01.400 is
00:00:01.599 basically
00:00:02.000 what
00:00:02.159 is
00:00:02.399 happening
00:00:03.480 in
00:00:03.880 a
00:00:05.240 an
00:00:05.440 example
00:00:05.879 over
00:00:06.160 here
00:00:06.440 where
00:00:06.560 we
00:00:06.799 have
00:00:07.439 an
00:00:07.600 input
00:00:08.760 image
00:00:10.000 and
00:00:10.679 we
00:00:10.800 are
00:00:11.120 actually
00:00:11.480 sliding
00:00:12.160 a
00:00:12.360 kernel
00:00:12.759 a
00:00:12.840 3X3
00:00:13.799 kernel
00:00:15.160 and
00:00:15.719 we
00:00:15.839 are
00:00:16.039 getting
00:00:16.480 an
00:00:17.840 output
00:00:18.240 feature
00:00:18.600 map
00:00:18.920 so
00:00:19.119 the
00:00:19.279 input
00:00:19.640 feature
00:00:19.960 map
00:00:20.640 here
00:00:21.640 is
00:00:22.119 just
00:00:22.359 has
00:00:23.000 one
00:00:24.000 we
00:00:24.160 will
00:00:24.320 be
00:00:24.519 calling
00:00:25.160 sometimes
00:00:25.560 this
00:00:27.560 depth
00:00:28.759 Channel
00:00:30.599 and
00:00:31.080 the
00:00:31.199 output
00:00:31.519 feature
00:00:31.800 map
00:00:32.040 has
00:00:32.360 again
00:00:32.840 one
00:00:33.120 channel
00:00:33.520 over
00:00:34.360 here
00:00:35.360 and
00:00:36.000 what
00:00:36.239 we
00:00:36.440 have
00:00:36.719 here
00:00:37.040 is
00:00:37.239 we
00:00:37.480 have
00:00:38.239 a
00:00:38.399 couple
00:00:38.640 of
00:00:38.840 things
00:00:39.040 that
00:00:39.200 we
00:00:39.280 need
00:00:39.440 to
00:00:39.640 introduce
00:00:40.640 as
00:00:40.879 terms
00:00:41.559 in
00:00:42.399 convolutional
00:00:43.840 operations
00:00:44.360 that
00:00:44.520 we
00:00:44.760 actually
00:00:45.039 doing
00:00:45.399 and
00:00:45.559 inside
00:00:45.840 the
00:00:46.000 convolutional
00:00:46.520 new
00:00:46.800 networks
00:00:47.640 so
00:00:47.879 the
00:00:48.039 first
00:00:48.399 is
00:00:48.680 the
00:00:49.239 form
00:00:50.239 of
00:00:50.840 the

00:00:52.039 of

00:00:53.520 and
00:00:55.239 typically
00:00:55.760 we
00:00:55.920 are
00:00:56.680 padding
00:00:57.879 the

00:00:59.399 input
00:01:00.399 feature
00:01:00.879 Maps
00:01:02.000 in

00:01:02.440 to
00:01:03.320 do
00:01:03.559 two
00:01:03.840 things
00:01:05.040 we
00:01:05.239 achieving
00:01:05.640 two
00:01:05.840 things
00:01:06.600 probably
00:01:06.960 you
00:01:07.200 have
00:01:07.439 noticed
00:01:07.960 that
00:01:08.119 in
00:01:08.439 an
00:01:08.640 earlier
00:01:09.119 kind
00:01:09.280 of
00:01:09.520 discussion
00:01:10.040 or
00:01:10.240 we
00:01:10.560 had
00:01:11.560 the
00:01:12.640 operation
00:01:13.400 of
00:01:13.920 cross
00:01:14.280 correlation
00:01:14.920 operation
00:01:15.520 in
00:01:15.720 this
00:01:16.040 in
00:01:16.200 this
00:01:16.360 kind
00:01:16.520 of
00:01:16.680 image
00:01:17.000 over
00:01:17.280 here
00:01:18.439 the
00:01:18.640 output
00:01:19.080 feature
00:01:19.439 map
00:01:19.840 was
00:01:20.240 always
00:01:21.280 smaller
00:01:22.280 in
00:01:22.439 terms
00:01:22.759 of
00:01:23.200 speciaal
00:01:23.799 dimensions
00:01:24.439 compared
00:01:24.799 to
00:01:24.920 the
00:01:25.079 input
00:01:25.439 feature
00:01:25.880 map
00:01:26.880 and
00:01:27.720 it
00:01:27.840 is
00:01:28.040 evidently
00:01:28.560 so
00:01:29.920 because
00:01:30.240 the
00:01:30.439 only
00:01:30.759 way
00:01:31.079 that
00:01:31.320 this

00:01:32.360 feature
00:01:32.720 MK
00:01:33.079 can
00:01:33.280 be
00:01:33.600 exactly
00:01:34.079 the
00:01:34.240 same

00:01:34.799 as
00:01:34.960 the
00:01:35.240 input
00:01:36.240 is
00:01:36.560 when
00:01:36.799 the

00:01:37.360 is
00:01:37.520 1
00:01:37.759 by
00:01:38.000 one
00:01:38.360 so
00:01:38.520 when
00:01:38.680 the

00:01:39.240 has

00:01:40.600 by
00:01:40.759 one
00:01:41.680 then
00:01:41.880 we
00:01:42.040 have
00:01:42.320 exactly
00:01:42.840 that
00:01:43.439 situation
00:01:44.119 but
00:01:44.360 in
00:01:45.280 most
00:01:45.560 cases
00:01:46.000 where
00:01:46.159 the

00:01:46.680 won't
00:01:46.920 be
00:01:47.119 one
00:01:47.360 by
00:01:47.560 one
00:01:48.360 we
00:01:48.520 will
00:01:48.799 expect
00:01:49.200 this
00:01:49.439 output
00:01:49.799 feature
00:01:50.159 maps

00:01:51.439 of

00:01:53.200 and

00:01:54.200 to
00:01:54.360 shrink
00:01:54.880 too
00:01:55.240 much
00:01:56.439 because
00:01:57.039 sooner
00:01:57.360 or
00:01:57.560 later
00:01:58.520 we
00:01:58.680 will
00:01:58.920 be
00:01:59.200 running

00:02:01.719 our

00:02:02.560 and
00:02:02.719 therefore
00:02:03.039 we
00:02:03.159 cannot
00:02:03.479 really
00:02:03.719 go
00:02:04.000 deep
00:02:04.799 to

00:02:07.000 in

00:02:08.119 so
00:02:08.319 what

00:02:09.000 to

00:02:10.160 have
00:02:10.399 done
00:02:11.200 is

00:02:14.000 we

00:02:21.319 over
00:02:21.760 here
00:02:23.040 then

00:02:31.519 so
00:02:31.840 if
00:02:31.959 you

00:02:43.959 the

00:02:44.680 but

00:02:48.080 it
00:02:48.360 visually
00:02:48.920 then
00:02:49.080 you

00:02:49.360 actually
00:02:49.599 see
00:02:49.840 it's

00:02:56.280 now

00:03:01.879 of

00:03:11.680 a

00:04:00.319 that
00:04:00.480 we

00:04:09.720 map
00:04:10.000 with

00:04:15.840 also
00:04:17.040 sort
00:04:17.280 of

00:04:20.079 so
00:04:20.320 stride
00:04:20.840 is
00:04:22.000 the
00:04:22.400 just
00:04:22.600 like
00:04:23.000 the

00:04:23.440 that
00:04:23.560 you

00:04:25.560 it
00:04:26.040 this
00:04:26.240 here
00:04:26.440 actually
00:04:26.759 refers

00:04:31.440 that
00:04:31.560 you
00:04:31.680 are

00:04:38.560 so
00:04:38.759 here
00:04:38.919 you
00:04:39.039 see
00:04:39.320 two

00:04:49.440 was
00:04:50.240 one

00:04:52.560 K
00:04:53.039 have

00:04:54.440 here
00:04:55.720 and

00:04:57.000 of
00:04:57.199 two
00:04:58.199 then
00:04:58.400 we
00:04:58.560 don't
00:04:59.320 get

00:05:04.280 this
00:05:04.400 is
00:05:04.840 obviously
00:05:05.360 is
00:05:05.600 helping
00:05:06.039 us
00:05:06.320 to

00:05:10.240 in
00:05:10.440 fact
00:05:10.720 goes
00:05:11.479 slightly
00:05:11.919 to

00:05:14.919 earlier
00:05:15.919 in
00:05:16.039 a

00:05:16.600 that
00:05:17.000 in
00:05:17.120 some
00:05:17.360 instances
00:05:17.840 we
00:05:18.440 prefer
00:05:18.919 to
00:05:20.280 get
00:05:21.039 for
00:05:21.280 some

00:05:56.600 that
00:05:56.800 kind
00:05:56.960 of
00:05:57.120 reinforce
00:05:57.880 what
00:05:58.080 we
00:05:58.240 have
00:05:58.759 just
00:05:59.319 quoted
00:05:59.639 Ed
00:06:00.639 without

00:06:10.880 something

00:06:14.360 correlation
00:06:15.000 with

00:06:16.479 you
00:06:16.639 know
00:06:16.840 not
00:06:17.080 very
00:06:17.520 useful
00:06:18.680 with

00:06:19.400 this
00:06:19.560 is
00:06:19.759 we
00:06:20.000 avoid
00:06:20.919 that
00:06:21.919 and
00:06:22.599 here
00:06:22.840 we
00:06:23.039 actually
00:06:23.599 have

00:06:26.720 stride
00:06:27.440 so
00:06:27.800 I
00:06:27.960 suggest
00:06:28.360 that
00:06:28.560 you
00:06:29.039 study
00:06:29.639 this

00:06:30.680 to
00:06:30.919 just
00:06:31.120 get
00:06:31.319 the
00:06:31.479 gist
00:06:31.840 as
00:06:31.960 to

00:06:32.639 padding
00:06:33.000 and
00:06:33.199 stride
00:06:33.639 are
00:06:33.840 actually
00:06:34.120 offering
00:06:34.560 to
00:06:34.759 us
00:06:35.599 but
00:06:36.080 now
00:06:36.919 the

00:06:37.440 has
00:06:37.680 come
00:06:37.960 to
00:06:38.520 look
00:06:38.840 at
00:06:39.880 the

00:06:44.599 and
00:06:45.240 in
00:06:45.440 fact
00:06:46.160 the
00:06:46.560 describe
00:06:47.000 if
00:06:47.120 you
00:06:47.240 like
00:06:47.520 the

00:06:49.080 of
00:06:49.720 layer
00:06:51.120 in
00:06:51.720 detail
00:06:52.319 we
00:06:52.440 will
00:06:52.960 start
00:06:53.240 drawing
00:06:53.720 a
00:06:53.960 snapshot
00:06:54.960 of

00:06:55.800 layer
00:06:56.199 operation
00:06:56.960 that
00:06:57.120 will
00:06:57.319 actually
00:06:57.639 help
00:06:57.919 us
00:06:58.080 to
00:06:58.520 understand
00:06:58.680 the
00:06:58.840 general
00:06:59.280 case
00:07:00.280 where
00:07:00.520 we
00:07:00.919 have
00:07:02.199 input
00:07:03.199 U
00:07:03.560 and
00:07:03.759 output
00:07:04.120 feature
00:07:04.479 Maps
00:07:04.879 coming
00:07:05.199 into
00:07:06.120 the
00:07:06.240 CNN
00:07:06.919 layer
00:07:08.080 but
00:07:08.440 however
00:07:08.720 these
00:07:08.919 input
00:07:09.280 and
00:07:09.400 output
00:07:09.680 feature
00:07:10.000 Maps
00:07:10.479 possess
00:07:11.360 different
00:07:12.520 depths
00:07:13.520 and
00:07:13.720 this
00:07:13.800 is
00:07:14.360 another
00:07:14.840 parameter
00:07:15.319 that
00:07:15.440 we
00:07:15.639 have
00:07:15.800 to
00:07:17.000 understand
00:07:17.400 you
00:07:17.520 know
00:07:17.720 that
00:07:18.039 the
00:07:18.360 we
00:07:18.479 are
00:07:18.720 responsible
00:07:19.240 for
00:07:19.599 Designing
00:07:20.599 these
00:07:20.840 layers
00:07:21.479 with
00:07:22.120 that
00:07:22.759 the
00:07:22.919 depth
00:07:23.240 of
00:07:23.840 what
00:07:23.960 we
00:07:24.120 will
00:07:24.400 produce
00:07:24.960 is
00:07:25.160 our
00:07:25.440 responsibility
00:07:26.319 to
00:07:28.120 design
00:07:28.599 so
00:07:28.759 let's
00:07:29.199 write
00:07:29.720 now
00:07:30.319 draw
00:07:30.680 if
00:07:30.800 you

00:07:31.919 picture
00:07:32.479 of
00:07:32.759 that
00:07:33.000 CNN
00:07:34.000 layer
00:07:34.599 in
00:07:35.520 operation
00:07:36.520 okay
00:07:36.720 let
00:07:36.879 me
00:07:37.039 call
00:07:37.240 it
00:07:38.240 the
00:07:38.639 snapshot
00:07:39.360 we
00:07:39.440 will
00:07:39.639 see
00:07:39.960 just
00:07:40.120 a
00:07:40.280 single
00:07:40.680 snapshot
00:07:41.319 of
00:07:41.560 that
00:07:42.680 layer
00:07:43.680 and
00:07:43.840 this
00:07:43.960 will
00:07:44.159 also
00:07:44.440 help
00:07:44.680 us
00:07:45.280 understand
00:07:45.680 the
00:07:46.000 U
00:07:46.560 what
00:07:46.720 is
00:07:47.440 the
00:07:47.720 convolutional
00:07:48.360 neuron
00:07:48.759 we
00:07:48.879 already
00:07:49.199 have
00:07:49.360 seen
00:07:50.360 the
00:07:51.479 sort
00:07:51.720 of
00:07:52.240 sigmoidal
00:07:53.000 kind
00:07:53.120 of
00:07:53.280 neuron
00:07:54.440 now
00:07:54.599 we
00:07:54.720 will
00:07:54.919 see
00:07:55.360 in
00:07:55.479 the
00:07:55.680 in
00:07:55.800 the
00:07:55.919 fully
00:07:56.199 connected
00:07:56.879 dense
00:07:57.240 layer
00:07:57.639 architectures
00:07:58.280 now
00:07:58.400 we'll
00:07:58.639 see
00:07:59.599 the
00:07:59.960 convolutional
00:08:00.680 neuron
00:08:01.039 in
00:08:01.120 front
00:08:01.360 of
00:08:01.520 us
00:08:01.680 so
00:08:01.919 the
00:08:02.159 snapshot
00:08:02.720 let
00:08:02.879 me
00:08:03.039 call
00:08:03.159 it
00:08:03.319 snapshot
00:08:03.840 of
00:08:05.440 CNN
00:08:06.440 of
00:08:06.599 a
00:08:06.800 CNN
00:08:16.199 operation
00:08:17.199 all
00:08:17.360 right
00:08:17.560 so
00:08:17.800 let's
00:08:18.400 draw
00:08:18.960 now
00:08:19.240 the
00:08:19.400 general
00:08:19.840 case
00:08:20.080 as
00:08:20.240 we
00:08:20.440 discussed
00:08:21.080 that
00:08:21.280 we
00:08:21.520 have
00:08:22.400 an
00:08:22.639 input
00:08:23.120 volume
00:08:32.039 this
00:08:32.279 input
00:08:33.399 volume
00:08:34.800 is
00:08:35.599 associated
00:08:36.360 with
00:08:37.039 h
00:08:38.479 the
00:08:38.640 output
00:08:39.039 feature
00:08:39.479 map
00:08:40.360 of
00:08:40.519 an
00:08:40.800 earlier
00:08:41.360 layer
00:08:41.800 let's
00:08:42.039 call
00:08:42.320 that
00:08:42.519 layer
00:08:42.880 l
00:08:43.159 minus
00:08:43.519 one
00:08:43.800 this
00:08:43.880 is
00:08:44.120 basically
00:08:44.640 the
00:08:45.040 feature
00:08:45.560 map
00:08:45.839 that
00:08:45.959 was
00:08:46.200 generated
00:08:46.760 by
00:08:46.920 the
00:08:47.120 previous
00:08:47.560 layer
00:08:48.040 in
00:08:48.360 general
00:08:49.360 and
00:08:49.680 we'll
00:08:50.240 have
00:08:51.240 a
00:08:51.480 depth
00:08:51.959 of
00:08:52.480 capital
00:08:52.920 m
00:08:53.480 l
00:08:53.800 minus
00:08:55.880 one
00:08:56.880 it
00:08:57.000 will
00:08:57.320 have
00:08:57.839 some
00:08:58.079 kind
00:08:58.279 of
00:08:58.519 width
00:09:01.360 let
00:09:01.519 me
00:09:02.000 make
00:09:02.160 sure
00:09:02.440 that
00:09:02.839 you
00:09:02.959 can
00:09:04.720 see
00:09:05.720 here
00:09:05.959 this
00:09:06.040 is
00:09:06.320 WL
00:09:07.200 minus
00:09:09.880 and
00:09:11.079 the
00:09:11.480 height
00:09:12.000 over
00:09:12.360 here
00:09:13.360 would
00:09:13.640 actually
00:09:14.040 be
00:09:15.920 okay
00:09:16.519 this
00:09:16.680 is
00:09:16.800 a
00:09:17.000 depth
00:09:17.240 and
00:09:17.360 the
00:09:17.519 height
00:09:17.760 over
00:09:18.000 here
00:09:18.200 will
00:09:18.440 actually
00:09:19.040 be
00:09:21.240 h
00:09:22.240 l
00:09:22.560 minus
00:09:22.959 one
00:09:23.760 all
00:09:23.920 right
00:09:24.120 so
00:09:24.320 that's
00:09:24.640 basically
00:09:25.040 the
00:09:25.200 dimensions
00:09:25.640 of
00:09:25.880 my
00:09:26.560 incoming
00:09:27.800 volume
00:09:29.120 and
00:09:29.800 this
00:09:30.560 incoming
00:09:31.560 volume
00:09:32.680 has
00:09:33.680 some
00:09:34.000 kind
00:09:34.160 of
00:09:34.360 resolution
00:09:34.959 in
00:09:35.120 terms
00:09:35.399 of
00:09:36.160 number
00:09:36.519 of
00:09:37.120 height
00:09:37.440 and
00:09:37.640 width
00:09:38.920 pixels
00:09:39.920 let
00:09:40.079 me
00:09:40.279 just
00:09:40.800 draw
00:09:41.160 them
00:09:41.560 quickly
00:09:42.040 because
00:09:42.800 we
00:09:42.920 would
00:09:43.959 to
00:09:44.959 now
00:09:45.360 draw
00:09:45.760 the
00:09:46.040 U
00:09:46.720 what
00:09:46.880 will
00:09:47.040 be
00:09:47.240 the
00:09:47.399 output
00:09:47.839 of
00:09:48.079 out
00:09:48.279 of
00:09:48.480 this
00:09:48.680 operation
00:09:49.320 which
00:09:49.440 is
00:09:49.600 the
00:09:49.760 output
00:09:50.120 feature
00:09:50.480 map
00:09:51.480 now
00:09:52.440 the
00:09:54.760 output
00:09:55.320 is
00:09:55.480 going
00:09:55.720 to
00:09:55.880 be
00:09:56.040 generated
00:09:56.600 at
00:09:56.760 this
00:09:56.959 specific
00:09:57.399 moment
00:09:57.720 in
00:09:57.959 time
00:09:58.880 I
00:09:59.079 have
00:09:59.519 in
00:09:59.720 general
00:10:00.240 a
00:10:00.440 filter
00:10:01.440 that
00:10:02.800 has
00:10:03.800 3x3
00:10:04.800 special
00:10:05.320 extent
00:10:05.760 it
00:10:05.880 is
00:10:06.040 located
00:10:06.519 let's
00:10:06.680 say
00:10:06.920 here
00:10:07.120 at
00:10:07.279 this
00:10:07.480 moment
00:10:07.760 in
00:10:07.959 time
00:10:08.320 because
00:10:08.519 that's
00:10:08.680 why
00:10:08.760 you
00:10:08.920 call
00:10:09.040 it
00:10:09.160 a
00:10:09.920 snapshot
00:10:10.920 and
00:10:11.600 it
00:10:11.880 has
00:10:13.800 some
00:10:14.240 depth
00:10:15.200 I
00:10:15.360 want
00:10:15.519 to
00:10:15.760 discuss
00:10:16.120 a
00:10:16.240 little
00:10:16.399 bit
00:10:16.600 the
00:10:16.800 depth
00:10:17.160 what
00:10:17.320 makes
00:10:17.600 sense
00:10:17.800 for
00:10:18.040 this
00:10:18.240 depth
00:10:18.519 of
00:10:18.640 the
00:10:18.800 filter
00:10:19.200 to
00:10:19.440 be
00:10:20.560 but
00:10:20.760 it
00:10:21.040 when
00:10:21.200 it
00:10:21.320 is
00:10:21.480 located
00:10:21.959 over
00:10:22.240 here
00:10:22.839 for
00:10:23.000 sure
00:10:23.240 I'm
00:10:23.519 expecting
00:10:23.920 to
00:10:24.200 have
00:10:24.480 some
00:10:25.480 output
00:10:25.920 feature
00:10:27.079 map
00:10:28.079 this
00:10:28.320 output
00:10:28.720 feature
00:10:29.040 map
00:10:29.440 will
00:10:30.079 be
00:10:37.639 smaller
00:10:38.600 in
00:10:38.760 terms
00:10:39.040 of
00:10:39.240 spal
00:10:39.680 extent
00:10:40.079 that's
00:10:40.240 why
00:10:40.360 I'm
00:10:40.560 kind
00:10:40.680 of
00:10:40.839 drawing
00:10:41.160 it
00:10:41.320 like
00:10:41.600 this
00:10:42.440 it
00:10:42.639 has
00:10:42.880 some
00:10:43.160 kind
00:10:43.360 of
00:10:43.680 a
00:10:44.560 number
00:10:50.079 pixels
00:10:51.079 okay
00:10:51.279 and
00:10:51.440 we
00:10:51.680 have
00:10:51.880 some
00:10:52.079 kind
00:10:52.240 of
00:10:52.360 a
00:10:52.600 depth
00:10:53.560 and
00:10:53.800 this
00:10:54.040 depth
00:10:54.519 is
00:10:55.079 definitely
00:10:56.720 something
00:10:57.079 that
00:10:57.320 I
00:10:57.639 need
00:10:57.880 to
00:10:58.160 control
00:10:59.560 because
00:11:00.880 it's
00:11:01.120 one
00:11:01.279 of
00:11:01.480 my
00:11:01.959 main
00:11:02.240 design
00:11:03.200 parameters
00:11:04.200 I'll
00:11:04.399 be
00:11:04.560 calling
00:11:04.920 this
00:11:05.160 depth
00:11:07.519 ML
00:11:08.519 and
00:11:08.760 evidently
00:11:09.240 we
00:11:09.399 have
00:11:09.560 a
00:11:10.920 different
00:11:12.200 HL
00:11:13.519 and
00:11:14.519 WL
00:11:16.480 dimensions
00:11:17.480 and
00:11:17.680 this
00:11:17.800 is
00:11:18.000 basically
00:11:18.519 my
00:11:19.320 you
00:11:19.440 know
00:11:20.200 volumes
00:11:20.720 input
00:11:21.079 and
00:11:21.200 output
00:11:21.560 volumes
00:11:21.959 in
00:11:22.079 general
00:11:22.399 going
00:11:22.560 to
00:11:22.680 have
00:11:22.839 input
00:11:23.079 and
00:11:23.200 output
00:11:23.839 fors
00:11:24.839 so
00:11:25.639 the
00:11:25.800 question
00:11:26.200 I
00:11:26.399 actually
00:11:26.760 have
00:11:27.079 right
00:11:27.279 now
00:11:27.480 is
00:11:28.040 to
00:11:29.040 understand
00:11:29.360 a
00:11:29.399 little
00:11:29.560 bit
00:11:29.880 about
00:11:30.600 the
00:11:30.920 depth
00:11:31.399 of
00:11:31.680 the
00:11:32.120 filter
00:11:33.120 and
00:11:33.399 we
00:11:33.560 have
00:11:33.959 three
00:11:34.440 options
00:11:35.440 either
00:11:35.720 the
00:11:35.880 depth
00:11:36.120 of
00:11:36.240 the
00:11:36.399 filter
00:11:36.800 will
00:11:37.040 actually
00:11:38.040 be
00:11:39.279 deeper
00:11:40.000 than
00:11:40.720 the
00:11:40.959 input
00:11:41.320 feature
00:11:42.040 map
00:11:43.320 shallower
00:11:44.000 than
00:11:44.200 the
00:11:44.320 input
00:11:44.680 feature
00:11:45.040 map
00:11:45.560 or
00:11:46.519 exactly
00:11:47.200 the
00:11:47.360 same
00:11:47.639 depth
00:11:47.920 as
00:11:48.079 the
00:11:48.279 input
00:11:48.600 feature
00:11:49.040 map
00:11:49.760 so
00:11:50.160 let's
00:11:50.959 try
00:11:51.200 to
00:11:51.360 do
00:11:51.560 some
00:11:51.800 kind
00:11:51.959 of
00:11:52.120 reasoning
00:11:52.639 over
00:11:52.920 here
00:11:53.760 does
00:11:53.959 it
00:11:54.160 make

00:11:58.079 map
00:11:58.440 and
00:11:59.760 if
00:11:59.920 you
00:12:00.040 think
00:12:00.279 about
00:12:00.519 it
00:12:00.800 the
00:12:00.959 answer
00:12:01.279 is
00:12:01.519 no
00:12:01.760 it
00:12:01.839 does
00:12:02.000 not
00:12:02.200 really
00:12:02.399 make
00:12:02.600 a
00:12:02.760 lot
00:12:02.920 of
00:12:03.079 sense
00:12:03.959 because
00:12:04.800 at
00:12:04.920 the
00:12:05.000 end
00:12:05.160 of
00:12:05.240 the
00:12:05.440 day
00:12:05.880 we
00:12:06.040 are
00:12:06.200 going
00:12:06.360 to
00:12:06.480 be
00:12:06.680 correlating
00:12:07.399 the

00:12:07.959 of

00:12:08.639 filter
00:12:09.800 with
00:12:10.000 the
00:12:10.200 contents
00:12:10.600 of
00:12:10.839 the

00:12:11.600 feature
00:12:12.000 map
00:12:12.839 and
00:12:13.040 if
00:12:13.199 the
00:12:13.360 filter
00:12:13.720 is
00:12:13.920 actually
00:12:14.240 deeper
00:12:15.240 then
00:12:16.040 we
00:12:16.199 are
00:12:16.320 not
00:12:16.519 going
00:12:16.680 to
00:12:16.800 be
00:12:17.160 picking
00:12:17.480 up
00:12:17.720 anything
00:12:18.199 from

00:12:18.959 feature
00:12:19.320 map
00:12:19.680 because
00:12:20.000 we
00:12:20.120 are
00:12:20.279 going
00:12:20.440 to
00:12:21.360 so
00:12:21.600 why
00:12:21.880 have
00:12:22.000 it
00:12:22.160 deeper
00:12:22.760 okay
00:12:22.920 so
00:12:23.320 you
00:12:23.440 know
00:12:23.560 there's
00:12:23.760 no
00:12:23.959 point
00:12:24.240 of

00:12:25.800 if
00:12:25.920 it
00:12:26.040 is
00:12:26.199 shallower

00:12:27.600 feature
00:12:27.959 map
00:12:28.360 also
00:12:28.600 it
00:12:28.720 does
00:12:28.839 not
00:12:28.959 really
00:12:29.279 make
00:12:29.440 a

00:12:29.680 of

00:12:31.720 to
00:12:31.920 leave
00:12:33.079 content
00:12:34.240 that
00:12:34.399 the

00:12:34.880 feature
00:12:35.320 map
00:12:36.079 U
00:12:36.920 contains
00:12:37.399 for
00:12:37.600 us
00:12:38.760 on
00:12:38.920 the
00:12:39.120 table
00:12:39.720 so
00:12:40.800 the
00:12:41.000 so
00:12:41.160 the
00:12:41.279 only
00:12:41.519 reasonable
00:12:42.160 assumption
00:12:42.800 is
00:12:43.639 this
00:12:43.839 filter
00:12:44.320 to
00:12:45.279 be
00:12:46.279 exactly
00:12:46.800 the
00:12:46.959 same
00:12:47.880 in
00:12:48.079 terms
00:12:48.399 of
00:12:48.720 the

00:12:49.480 feature
00:12:50.000 map
00:12:50.320 depth
00:12:51.040 right

00:12:54.360 F
00:12:54.680 map
00:12:54.920 so
00:12:55.040 it's
00:12:55.399 just
00:12:55.600 basically
00:12:55.959 draw
00:12:56.240 it
00:12:56.440 as
00:12:56.920 such
00:12:57.920 and
00:12:58.399 it
00:12:58.639 in
00:12:58.800 fact
00:12:59.199 it
00:12:59.320 is

00:13:15.880 is
00:13:16.320 kind
00:13:16.519 of
00:13:16.760 important
00:13:17.199 and
00:13:17.440 what
00:13:17.880 is
00:13:18.040 actually
00:13:18.279 even
00:13:18.519 more
00:13:18.760 important
00:13:19.160 to

00:13:20.079 will
00:13:20.360 generate
00:13:21.360 as
00:13:21.560 we
00:13:21.800 will
00:13:22.279 see
00:13:22.800 shortly
00:13:23.800 what

00:13:25.519 not
00:13:25.720 generate
00:13:26.120 the
00:13:26.360 whole
00:13:26.839 volume
00:13:27.279 over
00:13:27.560 here
00:13:28.160 but
00:13:28.360 it
00:13:28.480 will
00:13:28.680 actually
00:13:29.120 generate
00:13:29.519 only
00:13:29.800 one
00:13:30.079 slice
00:13:30.560 out
00:13:30.760 of
00:13:31.000 that

00:13:32.079 volume
00:13:33.079 okay
00:13:33.240 to

00:13:34.240 of
00:13:34.440 important
00:13:35.000 Point
00:13:36.160 let's
00:13:36.839 do
00:13:37.120 the
00:13:37.279 following
00:13:38.160 let
00:13:38.320 me
00:13:38.560 take
00:13:39.399 the
00:13:42.240 sort
00:13:42.720 of
00:13:43.720 so
00:13:43.880 for
00:13:44.079 that
00:13:44.360 specific
00:13:44.800 snapshot
00:13:45.600 that
00:13:45.800 I'm
00:13:46.040 actually
00:13:47.199 right
00:13:47.519 now
00:13:48.279 I'm
00:13:49.079 generating
00:13:50.079 the
00:13:52.920 specific
00:13:53.920 let
00:13:54.040 me
00:13:54.720 drew
00:13:55.120 that
00:13:55.399 like
00:13:56.680 there
00:13:57.680 some
00:14:04.399 specific
00:14:05.399 result
00:14:06.079 which
00:14:06.199 is
00:14:06.320 a
00:14:06.519 scaler
00:14:07.120 therefore
00:14:07.399 it's
00:14:07.519 a
00:14:07.680 result
00:14:07.959 of
00:14:08.079 a
00:14:08.240 single
00:14:09.240 Pixel
00:14:10.600 from
00:14:11.399 this

00:14:12.360 which
00:14:12.480 is
00:14:12.720 located
00:14:13.480 at
00:14:13.639 the

00:14:15.320 I
00:14:15.680 comma
00:14:17.079 J
00:14:18.079 so
00:14:18.320 specially
00:14:18.920 wise
00:14:19.199 and
00:14:19.320 I
00:14:19.480 hope
00:14:19.639 you
00:14:19.800 remember
00:14:20.279 what
00:14:20.440 we
00:14:20.560 have
00:14:20.720 seen
00:14:21.120 earlier
00:14:22.120 in
00:14:22.440 the

00:14:24.279 architecture
00:14:25.279 sorry
00:14:25.560 in
00:14:25.720 the
00:14:26.000 CNN
00:14:26.440 architecture
00:14:27.320 diagram
00:14:28.480 we
00:14:28.600 are
00:14:28.800 let
00:14:29.279 just
00:14:29.399 show
00:14:29.639 you
00:14:30.399 U
00:14:30.800 that
00:14:31.040 kind
00:14:31.160 of
00:14:31.360 diagram
00:14:31.959 again
00:14:32.959 for
00:14:33.240 that
00:14:33.519 specific

00:14:34.639 let's
00:14:34.839 say
00:14:35.079 the
00:14:35.240 blue
00:14:35.600 La
00:14:35.959 snapshot
00:14:36.639 I'm
00:14:36.920 actually
00:14:37.279 generating
00:14:37.759 this
00:14:37.959 scalar
00:14:39.120 result
00:14:40.480 and
00:14:40.720 using
00:14:41.199 just
00:14:41.519 one
00:14:42.680 kernel
00:14:43.199 a

00:14:43.680 of
00:14:43.880 depth
00:14:44.199 one
00:14:44.480 in
00:14:44.639 this
00:14:44.839 case
00:14:46.000 so
00:14:47.000 as
00:14:47.120 it
00:14:47.320 will
00:14:47.560 actually
00:14:48.160 as
00:14:48.279 it
00:14:48.399 actually
00:14:48.680 turns
00:14:49.000 out
00:14:49.959 that

00:14:54.279 specific
00:14:54.839 snapshot
00:14:55.839 it
00:14:56.000 will
00:14:56.240 do
00:14:56.560 a
00:14:56.759 three-dimensional
00:14:57.519 correlation
00:14:58.440 and
00:14:58.600 it
00:14:58.720 will
00:14:59.680 still
00:15:00.279 generate
00:15:00.720 a

00:15:02.240 for
00:15:02.480 me
00:15:03.079 okay
00:15:03.279 and
00:15:03.480 that
00:15:03.680 single

00:15:04.480 will
00:15:04.680 be

00:15:06.839 okay
00:15:08.000 and
00:15:08.519 the

00:15:12.399 I
00:15:12.600 just
00:15:13.000 drew
00:15:14.000 now
00:15:15.120 we
00:15:15.240 will
00:15:15.519 call
00:15:16.160 that

00:15:31.920 me
00:15:32.560 just
00:15:33.279 rotate
00:15:34.279 them
00:15:34.600 this
00:15:35.759 90°
00:15:36.759 and
00:15:37.199 write
00:15:37.440 it
00:15:37.639 over
00:15:38.399 here
00:15:39.399 it
00:15:39.519 will
00:15:39.759 be
00:15:41.839 evidently
00:15:42.839 this
00:15:43.079 Dimension
00:15:43.519 will
00:15:43.680 be
00:15:44.360 ml
00:15:45.360 the
00:15:45.600 depth
00:15:46.680 Dimension
00:15:47.680 and
00:15:47.880 this
00:15:48.000 is
00:15:48.360 the
00:15:49.560 because
00:15:49.839 we
00:15:49.959 are
00:15:50.560 correspond
00:15:51.079 to
00:15:51.199 the
00:15:51.279 earth
00:15:51.639 layer
00:15:52.639 and
00:15:52.959 let
00:15:53.040 me
00:15:53.199 just
00:15:53.360 do
00:15:53.560 exactly
00:15:53.959 the
00:15:54.079 same
00:15:54.319 thing
00:15:54.519 with
00:15:54.639 the
00:15:54.800 filter
00:15:55.120 so
00:15:55.279 I'm
00:15:55.519 actually
00:15:55.800 taking
00:15:56.079 the
00:15:56.240 filter
00:15:57.160 and
00:15:58.319 decompose
00:15:59.199 it
00:15:59.759 over
00:16:00.040 here
00:16:00.360 to
00:16:01.040 the

00:16:02.040 Kels
00:16:02.560 that
00:16:02.720 it
00:16:04.880 contains
00:16:05.880 and
00:16:06.040 so
00:16:06.600 these
00:16:06.759 are
00:16:07.000 going
00:16:07.120 to
00:16:07.240 be
00:16:07.480 my
00:16:09.040 3x3
00:16:17.360 kernels
00:16:18.360 and
00:16:18.560 this
00:16:18.720 will
00:16:19.800 be
00:16:20.800 of
00:16:22.240 Dimension
00:16:23.399 ml
00:16:27.639 minus1
00:16:28.639 so
00:16:29.000 just
00:16:29.160 took
00:16:29.360 the
00:16:29.480 filter
00:16:30.160 rotated
00:16:30.639 90°
00:16:31.319 and
00:16:31.519 just
00:16:32.120 decompos
00:16:32.800 into
00:16:33.040 its
00:16:33.279 Kels
00:16:33.759 this
00:16:33.880 is

00:16:36.560 and
00:16:37.120 so
00:16:39.079 since
00:16:39.399 I'm
00:16:39.560 going
00:16:39.680 to

00:18:55.400 the

00:18:55.880 we
00:18:56.080 just

00:18:58.880 this

00:19:00.280 U
00:19:01.280 summation

00:19:03.919 definitely
00:19:04.280 I'm

00:19:12.480 therefore
00:19:12.880 dot
00:19:13.400 product
00:19:14.520 to

00:19:17.720 image
00:19:18.440 okay

00:19:25.280 operation
00:19:25.720 that's

00:19:41.720 is

00:19:52.000 it
00:19:52.080 will

00:20:05.080 now
00:20:05.440 are

00:20:24.080 minus1
00:20:25.080 all
00:20:25.240 right
00:20:25.440 so
00:20:25.640 we
00:20:26.039 have

00:20:30.919 yes
00:20:31.120 we
00:20:31.200 can
00:20:31.400 call
00:20:31.600 them
00:20:32.000 W
00:20:33.000 but
00:20:33.640 W
00:20:34.159 I
00:20:34.240 would

00:20:41.880 this
00:20:42.039 line
00:20:42.440 I
00:20:42.799 have

00:20:49.320 that
00:20:49.559 specific

00:20:50.559 however
00:20:51.000 is
00:20:53.159 provided
00:20:53.640 by
00:20:53.840 this

00:20:55.120 by
00:20:55.280 this
00:20:55.440 index
00:20:55.880 so
00:20:56.159 this
00:20:56.320 specific
00:20:56.720 Kel
00:20:57.080 is

00:20:58.720 and
00:20:59.000 the

00:20:59.880 it
00:21:00.080 is
00:21:00.559 going
00:21:00.840 to
00:21:01.039 be
00:21:01.840 generating
00:21:02.840 is
00:21:03.919 the
00:21:04.159 located
00:21:04.640 at
00:21:04.760 the
00:21:04.960 KL
00:21:05.520 depth
00:21:05.840 that's
00:21:06.039 why
00:21:06.200 I
00:21:06.320 need
00:21:06.679 this

00:21:13.760 KL
00:21:14.320 minus
00:21:15.000 one
00:21:16.000 okay
00:21:16.200 so
00:21:16.880 this
00:21:17.080 will
00:21:17.360 actually
00:21:17.720 be
00:21:18.000 the

00:21:21.919 that
00:21:22.039 are
00:21:22.279 going
00:21:22.600 be
00:21:22.720 so
00:21:22.919 a
00:21:23.039 four
00:21:23.360 dimensional
00:21:24.200 tensor
00:21:25.200 is
00:21:25.480 being
00:21:25.799 used
00:21:26.240 here
00:21:26.559 for
00:21:27.000 specifying
00:21:27.760 those
00:21:29.320 parameters
00:21:30.559 that
00:21:31.440 we
00:21:31.559 are
00:21:31.679 store
00:21:32.000 in
00:21:32.240 those
00:21:33.159 in
00:21:33.559 those
00:21:34.159 filters
00:21:35.159 and
00:21:35.320 in
00:21:35.520 fact
00:21:35.840 we
00:21:35.960 only
00:21:36.159 have
00:21:36.320 one
00:21:36.559 filter
00:21:36.960 right
00:21:37.120 now
00:21:37.600 so
00:21:37.840 a
00:21:37.919 four
00:21:38.159 dimensional
00:21:39.000 tensor
00:21:39.400 to
00:21:39.559 identify
00:21:40.080 the
00:21:40.240 parameters
00:21:41.200 that
00:21:41.400 we
00:21:41.559 have
00:21:41.760 used
00:21:42.480 in
00:21:42.679 this
00:21:42.919 specific
00:21:43.640 dot
00:21:43.880 product
00:21:44.200 over
00:21:44.400 here
00:21:44.640 this
00:21:44.720 is
00:21:44.799 a
00:21:44.960 three-dimensional
00:21:45.679 dot
00:21:46.000 product
00:21:46.960 and
00:21:47.159 as
00:21:47.279 you
00:21:47.400 can
00:21:47.679 imagine
00:21:48.679 as
00:21:48.840 I'm
00:21:49.039 sliding
00:21:49.559 the
00:21:50.159 filter
00:21:51.279 to
00:21:51.480 another
00:21:52.360 location
00:21:53.559 in
00:21:53.679 the
00:21:53.880 next
00:21:54.320 snapshot
00:21:55.320 the
00:21:55.480 only
00:21:55.799 thing
00:21:56.159 actually
00:21:56.440 is
00:21:56.640 changing
00:21:57.640 is
00:21:57.880 the
00:22:00.440 coordinate
00:22:01.440 that
00:22:01.880 is
00:22:02.080 being
00:22:02.600 produced
00:22:03.760 in
00:22:04.000 this
00:22:04.440 scaler
00:22:04.960 so
00:22:05.120 the
00:22:05.240 only
00:22:05.480 thing
00:22:06.000 so
00:22:06.320 by
00:22:06.559 moving
00:22:06.799 the
00:22:06.919 filter
00:22:07.320 around
00:22:07.760 I'm
00:22:08.039 changing
00:22:08.480 the
00:22:08.640 I
00:22:08.919 comma
00:22:09.200 J
00:22:09.919 of
00:22:10.120 what
00:22:10.320 I'm
00:22:10.600 producing
00:22:11.600 therefore
00:22:12.159 what
00:22:12.320 I'm
00:22:12.520 actually
00:22:12.919 going
00:22:13.080 to
00:22:13.200 be
00:22:14.880 is
00:22:15.880 a
00:22:16.799 slice
00:22:17.799 a
00:22:18.039 specific
00:22:18.520 slice
00:22:19.080 out
00:22:19.320 of
00:22:19.600 this
00:22:20.640 sort
00:22:20.880 of
00:22:21.480 output
00:22:21.840 feature
00:22:22.200 map
00:22:22.919 so
00:22:23.159 the
00:22:23.400 specific
00:22:23.840 slice
00:22:24.240 I'm
00:22:24.400 just
00:22:24.559 drawing
00:22:24.960 over
00:22:25.240 here
00:22:25.960 just
00:22:26.279 one
00:22:26.760 of
00:22:27.000 the
00:22:27.480 ml
00:22:28.000 slices
00:22:29.240 so
00:22:29.480 ml
00:22:29.840 slices
00:22:30.400 generates
00:22:30.880 the
00:22:31.080 complete
00:22:31.720 volume
00:22:32.600 so
00:22:32.880 this
00:22:33.080 slice
00:22:33.520 is
00:22:33.720 the
00:22:33.880 one
00:22:34.120 that
00:22:34.320 I
00:22:34.400 am
00:22:34.640 going
00:22:34.840 to
00:22:35.240 be
00:22:36.480 generating
00:22:37.240 this
00:22:37.520 complete
00:22:38.200 slice
00:22:38.600 so
00:22:38.760 effectively
00:22:39.200 a
00:22:40.240 matrix
00:22:41.240 and
00:22:42.520 so
00:22:42.799 from
00:22:43.080 one
00:22:43.360 filter
00:22:43.880 I'll
00:22:44.080 be
00:22:44.240 generating
00:22:44.960 a
00:22:45.159 single
00:22:45.799 Matrix
00:22:46.799 and
00:22:47.000 therefore
00:22:47.600 and
00:22:47.760 this
00:22:47.840 is
00:22:47.960 the
00:22:48.120 important
00:22:49.520 conclusion
00:22:50.520 from
00:22:52.360 we
00:22:56.799 multiple
00:22:57.799 we
00:22:57.960 need
00:22:58.120 multiple
00:23:03.000 filters
00:23:04.000 to
00:23:07.840 generate
00:23:08.840 the
00:23:14.159 feature
00:23:15.480 map
00:23:18.720 volume
00:23:19.720 so
00:23:19.919 for
00:23:20.120 a
00:23:20.360 volume
00:23:20.760 for
00:23:21.080 the
00:23:21.279 whole
00:23:21.640 thing
00:23:21.919 for
00:23:22.120 the
00:23:22.279 output
00:23:22.600 feature
00:23:22.960 map
00:23:23.640 we
00:23:23.799 need
00:23:23.960 to
00:23:24.080 be
00:23:24.480 creating
00:23:25.000 multiple
00:23:25.480 fatures
00:23:26.080 in
00:23:26.400 fact
00:23:27.400 this
00:23:27.679 thing
00:23:27.960 over
00:23:28.200 here
00:23:29.320 is
00:23:29.559 really
00:23:29.919 the
00:23:30.159 connectivity
00:23:31.000 diagram
00:23:31.880 of

00:23:34.320 what
00:23:34.480 we
00:23:34.640 call
00:23:34.799 a

00:23:36.000 a
00:23:36.120 single

00:23:37.600 is
00:23:37.960 and
00:23:38.120 the
00:23:38.240 operation
00:23:38.760 actually
00:23:39.080 we
00:23:39.200 see
00:23:39.440 over
00:23:39.760 here
00:23:40.039 is

00:23:47.880 that
00:23:48.039 we
00:23:48.159 have
00:23:48.360 used
00:23:48.679 over

00:23:49.840 if
00:23:49.919 you
00:23:50.080 like
00:23:50.360 the
00:23:50.520 filter
00:23:51.360 are
00:23:51.880 the

00:23:52.640 trainable
00:23:53.320 parameters
00:24:01.520 and
00:24:02.039 we
00:24:02.159 will
00:24:02.440 now
00:24:03.039 see

00:24:51.480 on
00:24:51.720 one
00:24:51.960 slices
00:24:52.520 let's
00:24:52.679 say
00:24:53.000 this

00:25:01.360 line
00:25:01.720 here
00:25:01.960 indicates

00:25:02.720 if
00:25:02.840 you
00:25:03.000 want
00:25:03.240 to
00:25:03.480 generate
00:25:04.240 the

00:25:05.240 output
00:25:06.559 volume
00:25:07.120 with
00:25:07.320 a

00:25:07.880 D
00:25:08.120 out
00:25:08.440 you
00:25:08.559 need
00:25:08.840 D
00:25:09.200 out
00:25:09.720 of
00:25:10.000 these
00:25:10.399 filters
00:25:11.120 you
00:25:11.240 need
00:25:12.080 D
00:25:12.440 out
00:25:13.120 of
00:25:13.399 these

00:25:14.799 in
00:25:14.919 order
00:25:15.159 for
00:25:15.360 you
00:25:15.559 to

00:25:19.679 feature
00:25:20.120 map
00:25:20.880 so
00:25:21.520 I
00:25:21.600 think
00:25:21.760 it's
00:25:22.240 worth
00:25:22.520 spending
00:25:22.880 some
00:25:23.200 time
00:25:23.679 in
00:25:23.960 this
00:25:24.760 animation
00:25:25.760 in
00:25:25.919 this
00:25:26.120 animation
00:25:26.679 you
00:25:26.799 can
00:25:27.000 actually
00:25:27.279 see
00:25:27.600 exactly
00:25:28.120 what
00:25:28.440 I
00:25:28.559 just
00:25:28.880 discussed
00:25:29.880 here
00:25:30.080 in
00:25:30.240 this
00:25:30.480 example
00:25:30.960 I
00:25:31.159 have
00:25:32.000 an
00:25:32.200 input
00:25:32.559 feature
00:25:32.960 map
00:25:33.200 of
00:25:33.399 depth
00:25:34.520 three
00:25:35.720 and
00:25:35.880 I
00:25:36.000 have
00:25:36.159 a
00:25:36.440 output
00:25:36.840 feature
00:25:37.240 map
00:25:38.240 of
00:25:38.600 depth
00:25:39.000 two
00:25:39.440 let's
00:25:39.679 assume
00:25:40.000 that
00:25:40.320 is
00:25:40.559 the
00:25:41.679 sort
00:25:41.919 of
00:25:42.120 a
00:25:42.279 design
00:25:42.720 parameter
00:25:43.279 which
00:25:43.399 I
00:25:43.520 want
00:25:43.720 to
00:25:44.159 implement
00:25:45.360 therefore
00:25:45.799 if
00:25:45.919 I
00:25:46.080 have
00:25:46.279 an
00:25:46.440 output
00:25:46.760 feat
00:25:47.080 map
00:25:47.320 of
00:25:47.480 two
00:25:48.000 I
00:25:48.080 need
00:25:48.360 two
00:25:48.720 filters
00:25:49.720 and
00:25:49.880 these
00:25:50.039 are
00:25:50.240 the
00:25:50.399 two
00:25:50.600 filters
00:25:51.159 this
00:25:51.279 is
00:25:51.440 the
00:25:51.640 filter
00:25:52.279 w0
00:25:53.200 and
00:25:53.360 this
00:25:53.480 is
00:25:53.600 the
00:25:53.760 filter
00:25:55.200 W1
00:25:56.200 and
00:25:57.120 evidently
00:25:57.760 the
00:25:58.039 each
00:25:58.399 of
00:25:58.559 these
00:25:58.679 filters
00:25:59.120 has
00:25:59.320 of
00:25:59.720 dep
00:26:00.000 depth
00:26:00.520 three
00:26:01.520 because
00:26:02.120 three
00:26:02.559 is
00:26:02.760 also
00:26:03.080 the
00:26:03.320 depth
00:26:03.760 of
00:26:04.000 the
00:26:04.279 input
00:26:04.679 feature
00:26:05.240 map
00:26:06.240 and
00:26:07.080 at
00:26:07.279 every
00:26:07.640 specific
00:26:08.120 snapshot
00:26:08.919 let's
00:26:09.159 assume
00:26:09.600 this
00:26:09.720 is
00:26:09.880 the
00:26:10.080 snapshot
00:26:10.760 that
00:26:10.919 I
00:26:11.120 just
00:26:11.320 drew
00:26:11.799 on
00:26:12.080 piece
00:26:12.320 of
00:26:12.840 paper
00:26:13.840 this
00:26:15.039 filter
00:26:16.039 is
00:26:16.320 located
00:26:16.880 at
00:26:17.120 this
00:26:17.919 specific
00:26:19.279 location
00:26:19.760 in
00:26:19.919 my
00:26:20.159 input
00:26:20.720 feature
00:26:21.120 map
00:26:21.919 and
00:26:22.080 it
00:26:22.279 is
00:26:22.640 responsible
00:26:23.640 for
00:26:24.200 creating
00:26:24.919 this
00:26:25.320 scalar
00:26:25.960 Z
00:26:26.960 which
00:26:27.120 is
00:26:27.320 nine
00:26:27.679 in
00:26:27.840 this
00:26:28.039 case
00:26:29.799 okay
00:26:30.000 so
00:26:30.760 if
00:26:30.919 I
00:26:31.080 may
00:26:32.120 and
00:26:33.279 as
00:26:33.440 far
00:26:33.640 as
00:26:33.880 the

00:26:35.159 feature
00:26:35.480 map
00:26:35.760 is
00:26:35.919 concerned
00:26:36.760 this
00:26:37.000 filter
00:26:37.640 is
00:26:38.640 only
00:26:39.799 able
00:26:40.240 to
00:26:41.000 plot
00:26:41.559 if
00:26:41.679 you
00:26:41.880 like
00:26:42.080 to
00:26:42.559 determine
00:26:43.559 the
00:26:44.399 this
00:26:44.640 specific
00:26:45.039 slice
00:26:45.919 of

00:26:46.799 feature
00:26:47.960 map
00:26:49.159 if
00:26:49.279 I
00:26:49.480 want
00:26:49.760 to
00:26:50.799 continue
00:26:51.799 then
00:26:52.000 we
00:26:52.120 will
00:26:52.399 see
00:26:52.919 that
00:26:53.159 the
00:26:53.360 second
00:26:53.760 filter
00:26:54.559 is
00:26:54.760 the
00:26:54.960 one
00:26:55.240 which
00:26:55.399 is
00:26:55.600 involved
00:26:56.200 in
00:26:56.480 the

00:27:00.480 feature
00:27:01.480 this
00:27:01.600 is
00:27:01.799 really
00:27:02.120 the
00:27:02.720 essence
00:27:03.720 of

00:27:04.840 convolution
00:27:05.520 I
00:27:06.000 suggest
00:27:06.440 that
00:27:06.600 you
00:27:06.720 spend
00:27:07.039 some

00:27:10.520 going
00:27:10.760 on
00:27:11.760 and
00:27:12.159 you
00:27:12.279 can
00:27:12.480 toggle
00:27:12.960 the

00:27:13.760 just
00:27:13.919 to
00:27:14.200 be

00:27:56.840 divided
00:27:57.320 by
00:27:57.480 the
00:27:57.600 strides
00:27:59.559 and
00:27:59.799 plus
00:28:00.080 one
00:28:00.679 okay
00:28:00.840 so
00:28:01.080 this
00:28:01.200 is
00:28:01.480 the
00:28:01.960 formula
00:28:02.519 that
00:28:02.720 will
00:28:03.880 that
00:28:04.120 you
00:28:04.279 can
00:28:04.519 actually
00:28:04.799 use
00:28:05.080 to
00:28:06.039 understand
00:28:06.320 exactly
00:28:06.679 what
00:28:06.840 will
00:28:07.000 be
00:28:07.159 your
00:28:07.440 output
00:28:07.799 feature
00:28:08.159 maps
00:28:08.480 are
00:28:09.000 in
00:28:09.159 terms
00:28:09.360 of
00:28:09.519 spatial
00:28:09.960 dimensions
00:28:10.600 and
00:28:10.880 of
00:28:11.039 course
00:28:11.640 this
00:28:11.799 will
00:28:12.000 be
00:28:12.159 the
00:28:12.360 input
00:28:12.720 feature
00:28:13.039 map
00:28:13.480 sizes
00:28:14.600 for
00:28:14.960 the
00:28:15.519 for
00:28:15.760 the
00:28:15.919 layer
00:28:16.360 that
00:28:16.559 follows
00:28:17.919 okay
00:28:18.120 so
00:28:18.760 what
00:28:18.919 will
00:28:19.159 actually
00:28:19.440 be
00:28:19.679 those
00:28:19.960 layers
00:28:20.960 I
00:28:21.080 think
00:28:21.880 it's
00:28:23.279 you
00:28:23.399 know
00:28:23.919 it's
00:28:24.320 quite
00:28:24.600 important
00:28:24.960 to
00:28:25.159 get
00:28:25.399 into
00:28:25.880 the
00:28:26.240 U
00:28:26.679 discussion
00:28:27.200 now
00:28:27.399 about
00:28:27.679 other
00:28:28.120 architectural
00:28:28.679 features
00:28:29.159 before
00:28:29.399 we
00:28:29.600 go
00:28:30.399 into
00:28:31.440 some
00:28:31.720 kind
00:28:31.880 of
00:28:32.159 a
00:28:32.799 discussion
00:28:33.320 about
00:28:33.559 the
00:28:33.760 advantages
00:28:34.279 of
00:28:34.480 convolution
00:28:35.480 layers
00:28:35.919 as
00:28:36.200 compared
00:28:36.519 to
00:28:36.640 fully
00:28:37.000 connected
00:28:37.399 layers
00:28:37.840 which
00:28:38.000 I
00:28:38.120 think
00:28:38.240 is
00:28:38.480 best
00:28:39.720 demonstrated
00:28:40.360 using
00:28:40.679 an
00:28:41.279 example
00:28:42.279 before
00:28:42.519 we
00:28:42.640 go
00:28:42.799 into
00:28:43.080 that
00:28:43.360 example
00:28:43.840 let's
00:28:44.919 look
00:28:45.120 at
00:28:45.360 another
00:28:46.679 operation
00:28:47.440 that
00:28:47.600 we'll
00:28:47.799 be
00:28:48.000 calling
00:28:48.919 the
00:28:49.279 max
00:28:49.600 pulling

00:28:50.840 general
00:28:51.240 pulling
00:28:51.799 layer
00:28:53.039 which
00:28:53.159 is
00:28:53.480 actually
00:28:53.760 described
00:28:54.200 here
00:28:54.320 and
00:28:54.399 it's
00:28:54.559 best
00:28:54.799 demonstrated
00:28:55.360 with
00:28:55.519 this
00:28:55.720 kind
00:28:55.880 of
00:28:56.399 image
00:28:57.720 and
00:28:57.880 this
00:28:58.640 case
00:28:58.960 what
00:28:59.120 we
00:28:59.240 see
00:28:59.840 we
00:29:00.000 have
00:29:00.159 an

00:29:00.679 feature
00:29:01.360 map
00:29:02.640 that

00:29:04.080 of

00:29:04.440 in
00:29:04.640 this
00:29:05.240 case
00:29:06.240 and
00:29:07.519 we
00:29:07.760 do
00:29:08.080 still
00:29:08.360 have
00:29:08.600 the
00:29:08.880 concept
00:29:09.240 of
00:29:09.440 if
00:29:09.519 you
00:29:09.679 like
00:29:09.840 of
00:29:09.960 a
00:29:10.080 kernel
00:29:10.440 that
00:29:10.559 we
00:29:10.720 slide
00:29:11.080 around
00:29:11.399 just
00:29:11.600 like
00:29:11.760 in
00:29:11.919 the
00:29:12.159 convolutional

00:29:13.919 but
00:29:14.120 in
00:29:14.320 this
00:29:14.559 case
00:29:14.880 instead
00:29:15.440 of

00:29:18.880 like

00:29:20.720 that
00:29:21.519 we
00:29:21.679 have
00:29:21.880 actually
00:29:22.240 also
00:29:22.440 seen
00:29:22.720 in

00:29:25.039 that
00:29:25.600 we
00:29:25.799 are
00:29:26.640 still
00:29:26.919 going
00:29:27.120 to

00:29:33.159 have
00:29:33.960 another

00:29:35.399 let's
00:29:35.840 call
00:29:36.240 that

00:29:37.039 in
00:29:37.200 this

00:29:38.000 it's

00:29:42.360 behind
00:29:42.760 this

00:29:43.320 that
00:29:44.240 we
00:29:44.360 are

00:29:48.960 product
00:29:49.600 but
00:29:49.760 we're
00:29:49.919 going

00:30:02.640 it
00:30:02.840 also

00:30:05.600 achieving
00:30:06.159 is
00:30:06.399 evidently
00:30:06.919 we
00:30:07.039 are
00:30:07.240 achieving
00:30:07.720 some

00:30:51.240 definitely
00:30:51.799 a

00:31:00.080 maybe
00:31:00.360 it

00:31:05.679 why

00:31:06.360 we're

00:31:17.240 but
00:31:17.399 I
00:31:17.519 think
00:31:18.639 the

00:31:20.600 potentially
00:31:21.159 could

00:31:22.880 more
00:31:23.080 intuitively
00:31:23.600 understood
00:31:24.200 if
00:31:24.360 we
00:31:24.519 see
00:31:24.960 the
00:31:25.080 three-dimensional
00:31:25.880 version
00:31:26.440 of
00:31:27.279 this
00:31:27.519 one
00:31:27.720 by
00:31:28.039 one
00:31:28.200 convolution
00:31:28.919 so
00:31:29.559 we
00:31:29.760 have
00:31:30.200 a
00:31:30.799 see
00:31:31.159 here
00:31:31.480 the
00:31:32.399 orange
00:31:33.399 U
00:31:34.240 filter
00:31:35.159 that
00:31:35.360 evidently
00:31:35.799 the
00:31:35.919 K
00:31:36.320 size
00:31:36.600 is
00:31:36.760 one
00:31:36.960 by
00:31:37.240 one
00:31:38.600 and
00:31:39.039 we
00:31:39.200 have
00:31:39.760 as
00:31:39.880 we
00:31:40.080 discussed
00:31:40.519 earlier
00:31:41.360 depth
00:31:41.880 D
00:31:42.399 that
00:31:42.559 matches
00:31:43.000 the
00:31:43.200 depth
00:31:43.440 of
00:31:43.519 the
00:31:43.639 input
00:31:43.919 feature
00:31:44.240 map
00:31:45.080 and
00:31:45.279 as
00:31:45.440 we
00:31:45.600 also
00:31:45.880 discussed
00:31:46.320 earlier
00:31:46.919 the
00:31:49.519 this
00:31:49.679 filter
00:31:50.159 operation
00:31:51.159 will
00:31:51.440 move
00:31:52.120 around
00:31:53.360 we
00:31:54.159 we're
00:31:54.399 sliding
00:31:55.320 around
00:31:55.639 this
00:31:55.799 filter
00:31:56.120 and
00:31:56.279 we're
00:31:56.480 creating
00:31:56.880 one
00:31:57.159 slice
00:31:58.559 for
00:31:59.360 this
00:31:59.519 filter
00:32:00.360 so
00:32:00.639 in
00:32:00.840 this
00:32:01.159 one
00:32:01.399 by
00:32:01.559 one
00:32:01.799 convolution
00:32:02.440 we
00:32:02.639 have
00:32:03.320 just
00:32:03.519 one
00:32:03.799 slice
00:32:04.159 and
00:32:04.320 as
00:32:04.440 you
00:32:04.600 can
00:32:04.960 see
00:32:05.960 what
00:32:06.120 we
00:32:06.200 are
00:32:06.399 achieving
00:32:06.919 here
00:32:07.279 we
00:32:07.639 are
00:32:08.639 forming
00:32:09.200 a
00:32:09.679 scalar
00:32:10.840 by
00:32:11.399 combining
00:32:12.639 the
00:32:13.440 depth
00:32:14.039 compressing
00:32:14.600 the
00:32:14.760 whole
00:32:15.080 depth
00:32:15.399 Dimension
00:32:16.120 so
00:32:16.320 we
00:32:16.519 actually
00:32:16.919 have
00:32:18.000 we
00:32:18.080 are
00:32:18.200 seeing
00:32:18.559 typically
00:32:19.039 this
00:32:20.399 type
00:32:20.639 of
00:32:21.279 layers
00:32:22.279 let's
00:32:22.440 say
00:32:22.880 towards
00:32:23.240 the
00:32:23.360 end
00:32:23.559 of
00:32:23.679 an
00:32:24.080 network
00:32:25.039 the
00:32:25.200 top
00:32:25.399 of
00:32:25.480 the
00:32:25.639 network
00:32:26.159 where
00:32:26.360 we
00:32:26.880 just
00:32:27.080 before
00:32:27.399 the
00:32:27.559 head
00:32:29.120 where
00:32:29.320 we
00:32:29.440 want
00:32:29.639 to
00:32:29.919 just
00:32:30.639 summarize
00:32:31.320 everything
00:32:31.679 we
00:32:31.840 have
00:32:32.039 done
00:32:32.919 and
00:32:33.080 we
00:32:33.200 have
00:32:33.360 learned
00:32:33.720 in
00:32:33.840 terms
00:32:34.120 of
00:32:35.039 U
00:32:35.399 convolutions
00:32:36.360 operations
00:32:37.360 and
00:32:37.960 across
00:32:38.240 all
00:32:38.480 depth
00:32:38.799 Dimensions
00:32:39.240 that
00:32:39.440 we
00:32:39.600 have
00:32:41.120 decided
00:32:41.519 to
00:32:41.679 do
00:32:42.399 and
00:32:42.519 then
00:32:42.679 we
00:32:42.880 just
00:32:43.080 need
00:32:43.279 to
00:32:43.440 compress
00:32:43.919 that
00:32:44.080 information
00:32:44.519 to
00:32:44.679 a
00:32:44.799 matrix
00:32:45.279 and
00:32:45.679 potentially
00:32:46.240 that
00:32:46.399 kind
00:32:46.559 of
00:32:47.559 slice
00:32:48.760 is
00:32:48.960 going
00:32:49.159 to
00:32:49.320 be
00:32:49.480 flattened
00:32:50.320 in
00:32:50.480 order
00:32:50.760 to
00:32:50.880 be
00:32:51.039 passed
00:32:51.399 over
00:32:52.120 into
00:32:52.360 the
00:32:53.159 head
00:32:54.399 which
00:32:54.639 may
00:32:54.919 consist
00:32:55.320 of
00:32:55.559 fully
00:32:55.919 connected
00:32:56.360 layers
00:32:56.760 as
00:32:56.919 we'll
00:32:57.159 see
00:32:57.399 that
00:32:57.960 in
00:32:58.120 a
00:32:58.279 moment
00:32:58.720 okay
00:32:58.840 so
00:32:59.039 that's
00:32:59.240 one
00:32:59.519 application
00:33:00.039 of
00:33:00.200 the
00:33:00.320 one
00:33:00.559 by
00:33:00.720 one
00:33:00.960 convol
00:33:01.919 convolution
00:33:02.840 operation
00:33:03.840 all
00:33:04.000 right
00:33:04.279 so
00:33:05.279 it
00:33:06.080 kind
00:33:06.240 of
00:33:06.559 looks
00:33:06.840 like
00:33:07.039 an
00:33:07.600 multi-layer
00:33:08.200 Petron
00:33:08.720 or
00:33:08.840 a
00:33:09.000 dense
00:33:09.320 layer
00:33:09.840 as
00:33:10.000 it
00:33:10.159 is
00:33:10.880 combining
00:33:11.519 these
00:33:12.200 depth
00:33:12.559 Dimensions
00:33:13.080 into
00:33:13.880 that
00:33:14.120 scaler
00:33:15.120 all
00:33:15.279 right
00:33:15.559 so
00:33:17.519 let's
00:33:17.840 now
00:33:18.080 see
00:33:19.039 some
00:33:19.559 example
00:33:20.639 architectures
00:33:22.200 these
00:33:22.480 example
00:33:23.120 architectures
00:33:24.600 could
00:33:25.000 potentially
00:33:26.000 be
00:33:26.559 like
00:33:26.799 the
00:33:27.000 toy
00:33:27.320 Network
00:33:27.799 that
00:33:27.919 we
00:33:28.039 see
00:33:28.320 here
00:33:29.559 where
00:33:29.760 we
00:33:30.000 have
00:33:30.840 as
00:33:30.960 we
00:33:31.159 discussed
00:33:31.919 the
00:33:32.120 convolutional
00:33:32.720 layer
00:33:33.000 followed
00:33:33.360 by
00:33:34.720 nonlinearity
00:33:35.840 and
00:33:36.840 Max
00:33:37.159 pulling
00:33:37.519 layers
00:33:38.000 and
00:33:38.200 finally
00:33:38.600 at
00:33:38.760 the
00:33:38.919 end
00:33:39.559 we
00:33:39.799 expect
00:33:40.080 to
00:33:40.200 see
00:33:40.480 a
00:33:40.639 fully
00:33:41.240 connected
00:33:42.360 layer
00:33:42.840 that
00:33:43.000 is
00:33:43.159 going
00:33:43.360 to
00:33:43.519 play
00:33:43.919 the
00:33:45.600 role
00:33:45.840 of
00:33:46.080 the
00:33:46.639 of
00:33:46.799 the
00:33:46.960 head
00:33:47.200 of
00:33:47.320 the
00:33:47.559 network
00:33:48.720 where
00:33:48.919 we
00:33:49.080 have
00:33:49.279 let's
00:33:49.480 say
00:33:49.600 in
00:33:49.760 this
00:33:50.240 case
00:33:51.360 five
00:33:51.760 classes
00:33:52.240 that
00:33:52.399 we
00:33:52.519 would
00:33:52.720 like
00:33:52.880 to
00:33:53.039 do
00:33:53.399 a
00:33:53.600 classification
00:33:54.320 on
00:33:55.080 but
00:33:55.679 instead
00:33:55.960 of
00:33:56.120 looking
00:33:56.399 at
00:33:56.600 this
00:33:57.080 toy
00:33:57.399 Network
00:33:57.840 work
00:33:58.039 and
00:33:58.159 I
00:33:58.240 think
00:33:58.399 it's
00:33:58.639 a
00:33:58.760 bit
00:33:58.919 more
00:33:59.120 instructive
00:33:59.679 to
00:33:59.840 look
00:34:00.039 at
00:34:01.320 I
00:34:01.399 will
00:34:01.600 call
00:34:01.760 it
00:34:02.000 canonical
00:34:02.600 architecture
00:34:03.279 called
00:34:03.559 vgg
00:34:04.200 from
00:34:04.399 the
00:34:04.559 initials
00:34:05.080 of
00:34:05.360 the
00:34:06.480 authors
00:34:07.600 of
00:34:07.840 that
00:34:08.040 kind
00:34:08.200 of
00:34:08.359 architecture
00:34:09.040 this
00:34:09.320 architecture
00:34:10.720 is
00:34:12.159 I
00:34:12.480 call
00:34:12.679 an
00:34:12.839 architecture
00:34:13.320 that
00:34:13.399 I
00:34:13.520 suggest
00:34:13.879 students
00:34:14.240 to
00:34:14.440 start
00:34:14.839 from
00:34:15.720 every
00:34:15.960 time
00:34:16.200 they
00:34:16.320 want
00:34:16.480 to
00:34:16.639 look
00:34:16.800 at
00:34:17.000 these
00:34:17.280 convolutional
00:34:18.359 networks
00:34:19.000 because
00:34:19.679 they
00:34:19.839 do
00:34:20.079 represent
00:34:20.639 some
00:34:20.879 kind
00:34:21.040 of
00:34:21.399 a
00:34:21.960 initial
00:34:22.599 good
00:34:22.839 architecture
00:34:23.480 that
00:34:23.639 we
00:34:23.760 can
00:34:24.720 sort
00:34:24.919 of
00:34:25.079 make
00:34:25.280 some
00:34:25.679 conclusions
00:34:26.320 in
00:34:26.639 regarding
00:34:27.119 the
00:34:27.800 dimensionality
00:34:28.639 and
00:34:28.839 the
00:34:29.040 patterns
00:34:29.800 that
00:34:29.919 we
00:34:30.159 expect
00:34:30.440 to
00:34:30.599 see
00:34:30.800 in
00:34:30.960 a
00:34:31.159 typical
00:34:32.159 CNN
00:34:32.639 architecture
00:34:33.159 instead
00:34:33.399 of
00:34:33.560 looking
00:34:33.839 if
00:34:33.960 you
00:34:34.079 like
00:34:34.280 in
00:34:34.399 the
00:34:34.560 most
00:34:35.040 modern
00:34:36.200 versions
00:34:36.639 of
00:34:36.839 CNN
00:34:37.520 I
00:34:37.639 think
00:34:37.800 it's
00:34:38.040 worthwhile
00:34:38.599 looking
00:34:38.879 at
00:34:39.079 this
00:34:40.119 to
00:34:40.520 understand
00:34:40.679 a
00:34:40.800 couple
00:34:41.000 of
00:34:41.159 things
00:34:41.399 so
00:34:41.560 the
00:34:41.679 first
00:34:41.919 thing
00:34:42.119 that
00:34:42.280 we'd
00:34:42.480 like
00:34:42.679 to
00:34:43.800 capture
00:34:44.240 over
00:34:44.520 here
00:34:45.240 is
00:34:45.520 this
00:34:45.800 image
00:34:46.720 and
00:34:47.119 understand
00:34:47.359 what
00:34:47.480 is
00:34:47.599 really
00:34:48.599 happening
00:34:49.599 okay
00:34:50.200 so
00:34:51.000 the
00:34:51.200 image
00:34:51.520 is
00:34:52.639 the
00:34:52.879 in
00:34:53.040 this
00:34:53.200 figure
00:34:53.560 we
00:34:53.760 see
00:34:55.119 a
00:34:55.359 CNN
00:34:55.919 layer

00:38:31.599 increase
00:38:31.920 the
00:38:32.079 number
00:38:32.319 of
00:38:33.280 filter
00:38:34.119 parameters
00:38:35.119 and
00:38:35.280 still
00:38:35.560 you're
00:38:35.720 not
00:38:35.920 really
00:38:36.160 paying
00:38:37.319 any
00:38:38.800 complexity
00:38:39.400 this
00:38:40.040 sort
00:38:40.240 of
00:38:40.400 penalty
00:38:40.920 because
00:38:41.160 of
00:38:41.359 that
00:38:42.040 okay
00:38:42.200 so
00:38:42.359 these
00:38:42.480 are
00:38:42.680 the
00:38:42.920 two
00:38:44.079 things
00:38:44.319 that
00:38:44.520 we
00:38:44.720 need
00:38:44.960 we
00:38:45.079 can
00:38:45.240 actually
00:38:45.480 mention
00:38:45.839 about
00:38:46.160 this
00:38:46.319 kind
00:38:46.480 of
00:38:46.640 architecture
00:38:47.480 that
00:38:47.720 looks
00:38:48.160 again
00:38:48.480 like
00:38:48.680 a
00:38:48.920 pyramid
00:38:49.920 but
00:38:50.160 this
00:38:50.440 pyramid
00:38:50.839 is
00:38:50.960 a
00:38:51.200 kind
00:38:51.359 of
00:38:51.720 works
00:38:52.000 in
00:38:52.119 a
00:38:52.280 different
00:38:52.839 way
00:38:54.640 as
00:38:55.400 compared
00:38:55.760 to
00:38:55.880 what
00:38:55.960 we
00:38:56.079 have
00:38:56.160 seen
00:38:56.319 in
00:38:56.440 fully
00:38:56.720 connected
00:38:57.079 architect
00:38:57.440 pictures
00:38:58.359 and
00:38:58.640 now
00:38:59.480 I
00:38:59.560 think
00:38:59.720 it's
00:38:59.920 worthwhile
00:39:00.560 spending
00:39:01.000 some
00:39:01.280 time
00:39:02.040 on
00:39:02.599 U
00:39:03.480 on
00:39:03.960 an
00:39:04.200 example
00:39:05.119 and
00:39:05.240 this
00:39:05.520 example
00:39:06.079 is
00:39:08.119 a
00:39:09.200 python
00:39:10.599 notebook
00:39:11.599 this
00:39:12.359 example
00:39:12.800 is
00:39:13.000 actually
00:39:13.400 shown
00:39:13.640 over
00:39:13.920 here
00:39:14.160 you
00:39:14.280 can
00:39:14.520 actually
00:39:14.880 click
00:39:15.760 on
00:39:16.040 this
00:39:16.440 and
00:39:17.000 open
00:39:17.240 it
00:39:17.400 in
00:39:17.599 poab
00:39:18.079 for
00:39:18.599 execution
00:39:19.880 however
00:39:20.119 the
00:39:20.240 notebook
00:39:20.880 in
00:39:21.079 your
00:39:21.720 case
00:39:22.000 over
00:39:22.240 here
00:39:22.440 will
00:39:22.680 actually
00:39:23.040 be
00:39:23.720 working
00:39:24.160 as
00:39:24.319 it
00:39:24.480 is
00:39:24.720 so
00:39:25.119 in
00:39:25.920 the
00:39:26.119 next
00:39:26.359 video
00:39:26.599 we'll
00:39:26.839 go
00:39:27.000 through
00:39:27.200 this
00:39:27.560 example
00:39:28.040 and
00:39:28.280 then
00:39:28.720 see
00:39:29.720 exactly
00:39:30.160 what's
00:39:30.480 going
00:39:30.720 on
00:39:31.800 in
00:39:31.960 terms
00:39:32.240 of
00:39:33.200 and
00:39:33.560 the
00:39:33.720 API
00:39:34.200 and
00:39:34.359 the
00:39:34.480 implementation
00:39:35.000 of
00:39:35.119 a
00:39:35.240 CNN
