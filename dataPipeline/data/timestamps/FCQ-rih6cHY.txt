00:00:01.040 an
00:00:01.199 earli
00:00:01.520 video
00:00:01.760 we
00:00:01.880 have
00:00:02.040 seen
00:00:02.399 the
00:00:02.919 convolutional
00:00:03.960 networks
00:00:04.960 and
00:00:05.080 the

00:00:07.279 in
00:00:07.480 this
00:00:08.920 video
00:00:09.360 what
00:00:09.519 we
00:00:09.760 actually
00:00:10.040 introducing
00:00:10.880 here
00:00:12.200 is
00:00:12.679 residual
00:00:13.200 networks
00:00:13.880 which
00:00:14.040 is
00:00:14.599 to
00:00:15.040 this
00:00:15.400 day
00:00:16.560 several
00:00:17.000 years
00:00:17.279 after
00:00:17.560 the
00:00:17.760 introduction
00:00:18.520 remain
00:00:18.800 one
00:00:18.920 of
00:00:19.080 the
00:00:19.320 main
00:00:20.439 used
00:00:21.199 architectures
00:00:22.400 for
00:00:22.840 feature
00:00:23.320 extraction
00:00:24.080 and
00:00:24.240 not
00:00:24.439 only
00:00:25.320 as
00:00:25.439 a
00:00:25.680 basic
00:00:26.119 component
00:00:26.560 of
00:00:26.800 many

00:00:27.480 advanced
00:00:28.279 CNN
00:00:28.760 architectures
00:00:29.720 and
00:00:30.960 that
00:00:31.119 are
00:00:31.279 doing
00:00:31.960 more
00:00:32.640 complicated
00:00:33.200 tasks
00:00:34.040 such
00:00:34.280 as

00:00:35.079 detection
00:00:36.079 semantic
00:00:36.559 segmentation
00:00:37.280 and
00:00:37.440 others
00:00:37.719 that
00:00:37.960 we
00:00:38.040 will
00:00:38.200 see
00:00:38.680 in
00:00:39.200 another
00:00:40.559 in
00:00:40.680 another
00:00:41.280 video
00:00:42.559 so
00:00:43.280 the
00:00:45.520 history
00:00:46.000 if
00:00:46.079 you
00:00:46.239 like
00:00:46.440 of
00:00:46.640 their
00:00:47.120 introduction
00:00:48.360 you
00:00:48.520 know
00:00:49.079 started
00:00:50.239 around
00:00:50.879 2015
00:00:51.879 where
00:00:52.120 people
00:00:52.440 realized
00:00:53.199 that
00:00:53.680 it's
00:00:55.280 not
00:00:55.559 really
00:00:56.079 possible
00:00:56.520 to
00:00:56.800 extend
00:00:57.800 the
00:00:58.039 so-called
00:01:00.239 architectures
00:01:00.879 of
00:01:01.039 the
00:01:01.280 time
00:01:01.879 let's
00:01:02.079 say
00:01:02.359 the
00:01:02.800 vgg
00:01:03.920 architecture
00:01:05.000 we've
00:01:05.199 seen
00:01:05.400 the
00:01:05.519 V
00:01:05.960 architecture
00:01:06.680 on
00:01:07.200 a
00:01:07.400 different
00:01:08.040 U
00:01:08.600 video
00:01:09.000 earlier
00:01:10.000 in
00:01:10.200 this
00:01:10.720 in
00:01:10.880 this
00:01:11.080 actually
00:01:11.479 topic
00:01:11.840 over
00:01:12.240 here
00:01:13.439 where
00:01:13.680 we
00:01:13.840 have
00:01:14.040 SE
00:01:14.520 we
00:01:14.680 have
00:01:14.840 seen
00:01:15.240 the
00:01:16.080 sort
00:01:16.360 of
00:01:17.439 architecture
00:01:18.360 of
00:01:18.560 the
00:01:18.720 V16
00:01:19.880 Network
00:01:20.880 and
00:01:21.680 what
00:01:21.960 was
00:01:22.159 actually
00:01:22.520 happening
00:01:23.000 then
00:01:23.439 and
00:01:23.560 now
00:01:23.799 that
00:01:24.000 we
00:01:24.439 understand
00:01:24.640 a
00:01:24.799 couple
00:01:25.000 of
00:01:25.200 things
00:01:25.479 about
00:01:25.840 back
00:01:26.880 propagation
00:01:28.200 the
00:01:29.360 gradient
00:01:30.560 had
00:01:30.759 a
00:01:30.960 lot
00:01:31.119 of
00:01:31.360 problems
00:01:31.759 to
00:01:32.439 flow
00:01:33.439 all
00:01:33.640 the
00:01:33.799 way
00:01:34.000 to
00:01:34.200 the
00:01:34.399 input
00:01:34.799 of
00:01:34.920 the
00:01:35.439 network
00:01:36.640 and
00:01:37.600 the
00:01:37.920 U
00:01:38.119 sort
00:01:38.360 of
00:01:38.560 bottlenecks
00:01:39.320 that
00:01:39.520 were
00:01:39.720 actually
00:01:40.040 generated
00:01:40.680 created
00:01:41.119 a
00:01:41.320 significant
00:01:42.000 problems
00:01:42.320 in
00:01:42.439 the
00:01:42.600 training
00:01:43.000 of
00:01:43.320 these
00:01:44.520 architectures
00:01:45.320 so
00:01:46.560 2015
00:01:47.560 a
00:01:47.759 researcher
00:01:48.759 at
00:01:49.640 Microsoft
00:01:51.200 you
00:01:51.320 know
00:01:51.520 found
00:01:51.880 a
00:01:52.079 solution
00:01:52.840 on
00:01:53.200 how
00:01:53.439 to
00:01:54.159 enable
00:01:55.320 that
00:01:55.560 gradient
00:01:56.000 to
00:01:56.159 flow
00:01:57.680 freely
00:01:58.680 in
00:01:59.640 a
00:01:59.960 much
00:02:00.200 deeper
00:02:00.560 architectures
00:02:01.479 such
00:02:01.719 as
00:02:02.320 the
00:02:02.439 ones
00:02:02.640 that
00:02:02.799 we
00:02:02.920 will
00:02:03.039 see
00:02:03.240 in
00:02:03.360 a
00:02:03.600 moment
00:02:04.600 and
00:02:05.240 the
00:02:05.680 this
00:02:05.960 gave
00:02:06.280 their
00:02:07.479 the
00:02:07.640 name
00:02:08.000 residual
00:02:08.759 because
00:02:09.759 it
00:02:10.200 in
00:02:10.360 that
00:02:10.560 architecture
00:02:11.120 we
00:02:11.280 Implement
00:02:11.879 what
00:02:12.000 we
00:02:12.160 call
00:02:12.319 a
00:02:12.480 residual
00:02:13.040 unit
00:02:13.560 and
00:02:13.840 from
00:02:14.440 now
00:02:14.640 on
00:02:14.800 we'll
00:02:15.000 refer
00:02:15.400 to
00:02:16.200 those
00:02:16.400 networks
00:02:16.920 as
00:02:17.160 rest
00:02:17.599 nets
00:02:18.599 all
00:02:18.760 right
00:02:19.000 so
00:02:19.680 in
00:02:19.920 order
00:02:20.200 for
00:02:20.360 us
00:02:20.480 to
00:02:20.920 understand
00:02:21.519 what
00:02:21.800 is
00:02:22.080 going
00:02:22.280 on
00:02:22.480 with
00:02:22.680 rest
00:02:22.959 Nets
00:02:23.200 or
00:02:23.400 what
00:02:23.519 I'm
00:02:23.640 going
00:02:23.760 to
00:02:23.959 do
00:02:24.200 now
00:02:24.440 is
00:02:24.640 I'm
00:02:24.920 going
00:02:25.160 to
00:02:26.360 draw
00:02:27.640 a
00:02:28.480 very
00:02:28.800 small
00:02:29.319 rest
00:02:30.200 architecture
00:02:30.959 just
00:02:31.200 consisting
00:02:31.720 of
00:02:31.959 three
00:02:33.160 units
00:02:34.160 U
00:02:34.959 and
00:02:35.560 if
00:02:35.680 I
00:02:35.840 may
00:02:36.040 draw
00:02:36.879 the
00:02:37.040 architecture
00:02:37.720 will
00:02:38.560 that's
00:02:39.400 my
00:02:40.640 unit
00:02:41.040 which
00:02:41.239 I'll
00:02:41.519 abstract
00:02:42.120 with
00:02:42.519 the
00:02:43.519 letter
00:02:45.360 F1
00:02:46.360 so
00:02:46.599 the
00:02:46.760 input
00:02:47.159 to
00:02:47.560 the
00:02:48.560 so
00:02:48.720 I'll
00:02:48.920 use
00:02:49.120 a
00:02:49.280 bit
00:02:49.599 different
00:02:49.959 terminology
00:02:50.760 from
00:02:51.280 what
00:02:51.440 I
00:02:51.560 was
00:02:51.760 used
00:02:52.120 kind
00:02:52.280 of
00:02:52.480 earlier
00:02:52.920 so
00:02:53.080 I'll
00:02:53.239 be
00:02:53.360 calling
00:02:53.760 set
00:02:54.040 of
00:02:54.360 X
00:02:55.360 I'll
00:02:55.560 be
00:02:55.760 calling
00:02:56.200 it
00:02:56.760 y0
00:02:57.360 I
00:02:57.440 could
00:02:57.640 have
00:02:57.760 used
00:02:58.000 it
00:02:58.159 also
00:02:58.480 x0
00:02:59.080 but
00:02:59.280 in
00:02:59.400 my
00:02:59.560 not
00:03:00.000 over
00:03:00.239 here
00:03:00.440 I
00:03:00.720 have
00:03:01.959 the
00:03:02.920 this
00:03:03.080 as
00:03:03.400 y
00:03:03.680 z
00:03:04.599 okay
00:03:04.760 so
00:03:05.480 the
00:03:05.680 y
00:03:05.920 z
00:03:06.200 goes
00:03:06.519 into
00:03:07.560 a
00:03:08.640 block
00:03:09.640 that
00:03:09.799 will
00:03:10.120 consist
00:03:10.560 of
00:03:10.720 one
00:03:10.920 or
00:03:11.120 more
00:03:11.760 convolutional
00:03:12.480 kind
00:03:12.640 of
00:03:13.360 layers
00:03:14.360 and
00:03:14.519 in
00:03:14.640 the
00:03:14.840 residual
00:03:15.280 architecture
00:03:16.200 and
00:03:16.400 this
00:03:16.920 is
00:03:18.159 why
00:03:18.519 we
00:03:18.720 call
00:03:18.920 it
00:03:19.560 residuals
00:03:20.360 we
00:03:21.360 take
00:03:21.720 the
00:03:22.720 input
00:03:23.720 and
00:03:24.360 add
00:03:25.000 it
00:03:26.000 with
00:03:26.159 a
00:03:27.560 unit
00:03:28.760 gain
00:03:29.360 into
00:03:29.799 to
00:03:30.439 the
00:03:30.640 output
00:03:31.080 to
00:03:31.280 the
00:03:31.920 output
00:03:32.920 okay
00:03:33.120 so
00:03:33.519 to
00:03:33.720 form
00:03:34.360 what
00:03:34.519 we
00:03:34.760 call
00:03:35.360 now
00:03:35.680 a
00:03:36.239 y1
00:03:37.239 the
00:03:37.439 y1
00:03:38.159 is
00:03:39.080 being
00:03:39.480 added
00:03:41.599 into
00:03:42.599 again
00:03:43.480 with
00:03:43.760 exactly
00:03:44.239 the
00:03:44.400 same
00:03:49.360 approach
00:03:50.360 and
00:03:50.640 this
00:03:52.879 is
00:03:53.879 the
00:03:56.799 output
00:03:57.799 Y2
00:03:59.959 and
00:04:00.560 the
00:04:00.760 Y2
00:04:01.519 is
00:04:02.680 similarly
00:04:06.280 added
00:04:07.280 to
00:04:07.519 form
00:04:08.040 the
00:04:11.079 final
00:04:12.079 Y3
00:04:12.640 output
00:04:13.519 okay
00:04:13.760 so
00:04:13.920 this
00:04:14.040 is
00:04:14.280 the
00:04:14.959 kind
00:04:15.120 of
00:04:15.280 a
00:04:15.480 basic
00:04:15.959 rest
00:04:16.280 net
00:04:16.560 kind
00:04:16.720 of
00:04:17.440 architecture
00:04:18.639 in
00:04:19.120 U
00:04:20.120 and
00:04:20.280 if
00:04:20.400 you
00:04:20.560 compare
00:04:20.919 what
00:04:21.040 we
00:04:21.160 have
00:04:21.320 seen
00:04:22.000 earlier
00:04:22.479 with
00:04:22.600 the
00:04:22.919 cnns
00:04:23.919 we
00:04:24.120 had
00:04:24.840 convolutional
00:04:25.479 layers
00:04:25.840 Max
00:04:26.120 pool
00:04:26.320 layers
00:04:26.600 and
00:04:26.720 so
00:04:26.960 nonlinear
00:04:27.720 evidently
00:04:28.199 over
00:04:28.520 here
00:04:29.160 but
00:04:29.280 we
00:04:29.440 never
00:04:29.840 had
00:04:30.080 this
00:04:30.240 kind
00:04:30.400 of
00:04:30.520 skip
00:04:30.840 over
00:04:31.600 connection
00:04:32.759 as
00:04:32.880 we
00:04:33.080 call
00:04:33.600 it
00:04:34.600 okay
00:04:34.800 so
00:04:35.600 I
00:04:35.720 want
00:04:35.880 to
00:04:36.360 just
00:04:37.120 go
00:04:37.320 ahead
00:04:37.600 and
00:04:37.880 write
00:04:38.400 now
00:04:42.199 expression
00:04:42.960 of
00:04:43.400 the
00:04:43.639 output
00:04:44.400 of
00:04:44.639 each
00:04:44.880 of
00:04:45.120 these
00:04:46.800 blocks
00:04:47.800 with
00:04:48.039 respect
00:04:49.080 to
00:04:50.080 the
00:04:50.440 input
00:04:51.440 so
00:04:52.000 I
00:04:52.120 hope
00:04:52.320 you
00:04:53.080 agree
00:04:54.400 that
00:04:54.720 this
00:04:54.840 is
00:04:55.160 exactly
00:04:55.720 what
00:04:55.960 each
00:04:56.280 of
00:04:56.560 these
00:04:57.280 blocks
00:04:57.919 is
00:05:00.720 Implement
00:05:01.720 okay
00:05:01.880 so
00:05:02.160 we
00:05:02.360 have
00:05:03.479 the
00:05:03.720 FI
00:05:04.479 of
00:05:04.800 Y
00:05:05.440 IUS
00:05:06.080 one
00:05:06.479 plus
00:05:07.080 the

00:05:07.520 IUS
00:05:08.080 one
00:05:08.320 in
00:05:08.479 each
00:05:08.639 of
00:05:08.880 these
00:05:09.479 so
00:05:09.680 if
00:05:09.800 I
00:05:09.919 may
00:05:10.320 write
00:05:10.639 down
00:05:10.919 these
00:05:11.199 equations
00:05:11.759 for
00:05:12.520 let's
00:05:12.680 say
00:05:12.919 the
00:05:15.000 Y3
00:05:16.000 is
00:05:16.199 equal

00:05:19.039 +
00:05:20.360 Y2
00:05:22.240 the
00:05:22.479 Y2
00:05:25.000 itself
00:05:26.000 is

00:05:34.600 +
00:05:35.280 y0
00:05:36.280 these
00:05:36.440 are
00:05:36.759 the
00:05:37.199 three
00:05:37.479 equations
00:05:38.240 for

00:05:39.919 blocks
00:05:40.199 that
00:05:40.360 I
00:05:40.560 have
00:05:40.840 here
00:05:41.560 and

00:05:48.759 into
00:05:49.039 the
00:05:49.240 equation
00:05:49.680 Y3
00:05:50.199 because
00:05:50.400 I
00:05:50.520 want
00:05:50.680 to
00:05:50.840 write

00:06:05.319 F1
00:06:05.720 and
00:06:05.880 F2
00:06:06.720 okay
00:06:06.919 so
00:06:07.360 all
00:06:07.520 right
00:06:07.759 so
00:06:08.080 what
00:06:08.240 I'm
00:06:08.360 going
00:06:08.520 to

00:06:09.520 now
00:06:09.919 is
00:06:10.199 I'm
00:06:10.319 going
00:06:10.440 to
00:06:10.599 write
00:06:11.080 it
00:06:11.280 as

00:06:33.960 it
00:06:34.199 Y2
00:06:35.039 with
00:06:35.199 it
00:06:36.000 equal
00:06:36.800 and
00:06:37.039 now
00:06:37.400 I
00:06:37.639 can
00:06:39.280 replace
00:06:47.000 now
00:06:48.000 let

00:06:48.360 write
00:06:48.560 it
00:06:48.759 over
00:06:49.080 here
00:06:49.479 because
00:06:49.720 I
00:06:49.919 just
00:06:50.080 need
00:06:50.280 a

00:07:20.599 the
00:07:20.800 second
00:07:26.479 bracket
00:07:27.479 okay
00:07:28.400 so
00:07:28.639 it
00:07:28.759 is
00:07:28.960 really

00:08:20.520 throughout
00:08:20.879 the
00:08:21.720 network
00:08:22.720 okay
00:08:22.919 so
00:08:23.759 I
00:08:23.879 am
00:08:24.080 going
00:08:24.319 to
00:08:24.720 start
00:08:25.479 so
00:08:25.720 I'm
00:08:25.919 dividing
00:08:26.479 this
00:08:26.720 into
00:08:28.120 two
00:08:28.400 parts
00:08:29.879 I
00:08:30.000 am
00:08:30.240 going
00:08:30.759 to
00:08:33.159 first
00:08:34.599 draw
00:08:36.599 the
00:08:37.599 long
00:08:38.599 part
00:08:38.919 over
00:08:39.240 here
00:08:39.599 this
00:08:39.959 F3
00:08:40.519 expression
00:08:41.320 here
00:08:41.479 at
00:08:41.640 the
00:08:41.959 at
00:08:42.080 the
00:08:42.320 bottom
00:08:43.320 so
00:08:43.560 I
00:08:43.680 am
00:08:43.880 going
00:08:44.279 to
00:08:45.279 take
00:08:45.839 this
00:08:46.160 accepts
00:08:46.600 as
00:08:46.839 input
00:08:47.440 y0
00:08:48.240 that's
00:08:48.440 the
00:08:48.600 only
00:08:48.880 input
00:08:49.200 in
00:08:49.360 this
00:08:50.440 diagram
00:08:51.800 so
00:08:52.080 y0
00:08:52.760 is
00:08:52.920 going
00:08:53.680 into
00:08:54.680 the
00:08:57.760 F1
00:09:00.240 we
00:09:00.360 are
00:09:00.640 adding
00:09:01.120 now
00:09:01.800 the
00:09:02.000 function
00:09:04.440 the
00:09:04.959 y
00:09:05.240 z
00:09:05.519 into
00:09:06.040 it
00:09:07.040 okay
00:09:07.160 so
00:09:07.519 that's
00:09:08.320 basically
00:09:09.640 this
00:09:11.720 term
00:09:12.720 all
00:09:12.920 right
00:09:13.120 so
00:09:13.360 then
00:09:13.519 we
00:09:13.720 take
00:09:14.040 the
00:09:14.200 FS2
00:09:14.760 of
00:09:15.000 this
00:09:15.160 term
00:09:15.519 so
00:09:15.800 the
00:09:15.920 output
00:09:16.279 of
00:09:16.480 this

00:09:16.880 being
00:09:17.120 fed
00:09:17.720 to
00:09:19.680 F2
00:09:20.680 and
00:09:21.959 what
00:09:22.120 we
00:09:22.680 do
00:09:23.680 is
00:09:25.160 we
00:09:25.800 add
00:09:26.800 for
00:09:27.079 this
00:09:27.320 FS2
00:09:27.959 we
00:09:28.160 add
00:09:28.560 this
00:09:28.800 term
00:09:29.079 over
00:09:29.519 here
00:09:30.279 F1
00:09:30.839 y
00:09:31.040 0
00:09:31.360 +
00:09:31.760 y0
00:09:32.760 so
00:09:32.959 we
00:09:33.200 add
00:09:33.480 to
00:09:33.680 it
00:09:44.519 block
00:09:45.519 involving
00:09:46.240 the
00:09:46.399 function
00:09:51.360 F1
00:09:52.360 okay
00:09:52.560 so
00:09:52.880 this
00:09:53.000 is
00:09:53.760 basically
00:09:54.240 this
00:09:54.440 inner
00:09:54.839 term
00:09:55.120 over
00:09:55.440 here
00:09:55.720 and
00:09:55.839 then
00:09:56.279 finally
00:09:57.279 we
00:09:57.399 are
00:09:57.640 taking
00:09:58.040 the
00:09:58.240 F3
00:09:58.839 of
00:09:59.079 that
00:09:59.560 so
00:09:59.800 this
00:09:59.920 is
00:10:00.200 basically
00:10:00.839 my
00:10:02.200 F3
00:10:03.200 so
00:10:03.440 if
00:10:03.640 I
00:10:03.839 am
00:10:04.040 a
00:10:09.120 Circle
00:10:10.120 if
00:10:10.279 I
00:10:10.399 may
00:10:10.640 Circle
00:10:11.480 this
00:10:12.839 will
00:10:13.120 be
00:10:13.680 let's
00:10:13.920 say
00:10:14.760 a
00:10:15.760 this
00:10:16.040 a
00:10:16.440 will
00:10:16.640 be
00:10:16.920 available
00:10:17.480 over
00:10:19.760 here
00:10:20.760 okay
00:10:20.920 so
00:10:21.120 we
00:10:21.279 have
00:10:21.519 now
00:10:21.800 finished
00:10:22.160 with
00:10:22.279 the
00:10:22.440 plotting
00:10:22.839 of
00:10:23.000 the
00:10:23.160 first
00:10:23.720 term
00:10:24.720 and
00:10:24.920 now
00:10:25.360 let's
00:10:25.600 look
00:10:25.839 at
00:10:26.000 the
00:10:26.240 second
00:10:27.519 term
00:10:28.519 so
00:10:28.839 the
00:10:29.040 second
00:10:29.600 term
00:10:29.959 is
00:10:30.959 simply
00:10:31.399 FS2
00:10:31.880 of
00:10:32.079 y1
00:10:32.640 y
00:10:32.800 0
00:10:33.120 +
00:10:33.880 y0
00:10:34.880 so
00:10:35.480 I
00:10:35.600 am
00:10:35.839 going
00:10:36.040 to
00:10:36.279 go
00:10:37.200 again
00:10:42.320 here
00:10:43.320 this
00:10:43.480 is
00:10:43.680 in
00:10:44.360 fact
00:10:45.360 just
00:10:45.920 one
00:10:50.079 line
00:10:51.079 so
00:10:51.279 I'm
00:10:51.399 going
00:10:51.560 to
00:10:51.760 just
00:10:51.959 take
00:10:52.279 again
00:10:54.480 fub1
00:10:55.480 of
00:10:56.279 y0
00:10:57.279 +
00:10:57.720 y0
00:10:59.720 and
00:10:59.920 I'm
00:11:00.120 simply
00:11:00.680 going
00:11:00.920 to
00:11:01.160 take
00:11:01.440 the
00:11:01.600 F2
00:11:02.040 of
00:11:05.399 that
00:11:06.399 and
00:11:07.079 this
00:11:07.360 thing
00:11:07.639 over
00:11:08.000 here
00:11:09.800 is
00:11:10.800 the
00:11:11.040 point
00:11:14.160 B
00:11:15.240 however
00:11:18.240 this
00:11:18.519 so
00:11:18.760 this
00:11:18.880 is
00:11:19.079 basically
00:11:19.600 B
00:11:20.160 let
00:11:20.320 me
00:11:21.959 throw
00:11:22.279 it
00:11:22.440 over
00:11:25.160 here
00:11:26.160 to
00:11:26.399 B
00:11:26.720 now
00:11:27.079 what
00:11:27.240 we
00:11:27.440 have
00:11:27.680 is
00:11:27.880 we
00:11:28.079 simply
00:11:28.680 add
00:11:29.440 another
00:11:29.839 of
00:11:30.040 these
00:11:37.720 guys
00:11:38.720 we
00:11:38.920 add
00:11:39.279 to
00:11:40.680 be
00:11:41.680 this
00:11:42.000 and
00:11:42.160 I
00:11:42.279 would
00:11:42.480 like
00:11:42.760 to
00:11:43.760 Circle
00:11:44.360 that
00:11:44.600 over
00:11:45.079 because
00:11:45.600 we
00:11:45.839 see
00:11:46.680 here
00:11:47.680 three
00:11:47.959 things
00:11:48.200 being
00:11:48.519 involved
00:11:49.079 a
00:11:49.320 b
00:11:49.639 and
00:11:49.880 c
00:11:50.240 so
00:11:50.480 this
00:11:50.639 is
00:11:52.920 C
00:11:53.920 and
00:11:54.120 then
00:11:55.000 B
00:11:55.320 and
00:11:56.079 C
00:11:57.079 are
00:11:57.399 added
00:11:57.880 to
00:11:58.160 a
00:12:04.279 and
00:12:04.480 this
00:12:04.639 will
00:12:04.959 actually
00:12:05.279 be
00:12:05.519 my
00:12:07.600 Y3
00:12:08.600 and
00:12:08.720 now
00:12:08.920 that
00:12:09.079 we
00:12:09.240 have
00:12:09.480 this
00:12:09.680 kind
00:12:09.839 of
00:12:10.079 diagram
00:12:10.600 we
00:12:10.839 actually
00:12:11.120 can
00:12:11.360 make
00:12:11.920 some
00:12:12.360 really
00:12:12.720 nice
00:12:13.600 conclusions
00:12:14.279 out
00:12:14.480 of
00:12:14.760 it
00:12:16.279 as
00:12:16.399 you
00:12:16.560 can
00:12:17.480 see
00:12:19.079 the
00:12:19.320 gradient
00:12:19.880 in
00:12:20.040 the
00:12:20.199 backward
00:12:20.720 pass
00:12:21.040 so
00:12:21.279 the
00:12:21.480 point
00:12:21.720 number
00:12:21.959 one
00:12:22.120 I
00:12:22.240 want
00:12:22.399 to
00:12:22.519 mention
00:12:22.839 is
00:12:23.000 about
00:12:23.279 the
00:12:23.440 gradient
00:12:23.839 flow
00:12:29.360 so
00:12:29.560 you
00:12:29.680 can
00:12:29.800 see
00:12:30.040 the
00:12:30.160 gradient
00:12:30.560 flow
00:12:30.839 in
00:12:30.920 the
00:12:31.040 backward
00:12:31.600 pass
00:12:32.120 during
00:12:32.480 back
00:12:32.800 propagation
00:12:33.760 now
00:12:34.279 has
00:12:35.279 a
00:12:36.160 diverse
00:12:36.760 set
00:12:37.040 of
00:12:37.440 paths
00:12:38.000 and
00:12:38.600 to
00:12:38.880 actually
00:12:39.160 flow
00:12:39.920 all
00:12:40.120 the
00:12:40.279 way
00:12:40.440 to
00:12:40.600 the
00:12:40.760 input
00:12:41.639 let's
00:12:41.880 say
00:12:42.040 it
00:12:42.199 has
00:12:42.480 this
00:12:43.000 path
00:12:43.399 that
00:12:44.079 simply
00:12:44.680 just
00:12:44.880 follows
00:12:45.519 all
00:12:45.680 the
00:12:45.800 way
00:12:46.000 to
00:12:46.199 the
00:12:46.720 input
00:12:47.279 y
00:12:47.560 z
00:12:48.519 the
00:12:48.680 other
00:12:49.040 path
00:12:49.279 that
00:12:49.480 goes
00:12:50.480 through
00:12:51.480 this
00:12:51.800 F1
00:12:52.680 to
00:12:52.880 go
00:12:53.040 to
00:12:53.240 the
00:12:53.399 input
00:12:54.279 this
00:12:54.600 path
00:12:54.880 through
00:12:55.160 F2
00:12:56.079 and
00:12:56.320 F
00:12:56.600 the
00:12:56.720 concatenation
00:12:57.399 F2
00:12:57.839 and
00:12:58.240 fub1
00:12:59.199 or
00:12:59.399 via
00:12:59.800 this
00:13:00.279 skip
00:13:00.639 connection
00:13:01.120 to
00:13:01.279 go
00:13:01.440 to
00:13:01.600 F0
00:13:02.079 and
00:13:02.199 so
00:13:02.360 on
00:13:02.519 and
00:13:02.680 so
00:13:02.839 on
00:13:03.120 so
00:13:03.680 what
00:13:03.800 we
00:13:03.959 see
00:13:04.240 here
00:13:04.440 is
00:13:04.639 we
00:13:04.839 have
00:13:05.199 a
00:13:08.079 diverse
00:13:09.240 set
00:13:09.519 of
00:13:13.760 paths
00:13:17.639 through
00:13:28.240 of
00:13:28.720 s
00:13:29.000 of
00:13:29.760 gates
00:13:30.120 I
00:13:30.240 will
00:13:30.440 call
00:13:30.680 it
00:13:31.680 because
00:13:32.000 this
00:13:32.120 is
00:13:32.320 what
00:13:32.440 we
00:13:32.600 have
00:13:32.760 used
00:13:33.680 as
00:13:33.800 a
00:13:33.959 term
00:13:34.199 from
00:13:34.399 back
00:13:35.240 propagation
00:13:36.240 of
00:13:41.320 varing
00:13:44.079 depth
00:13:45.079 okay
00:13:45.320 for
00:13:45.560 varing
00:13:46.000 depth
00:13:46.720 so
00:13:46.920 that's
00:13:47.120 kind
00:13:47.279 of
00:13:47.480 important
00:13:48.160 earlier
00:13:48.760 what
00:13:48.920 we
00:13:49.120 had
00:13:49.399 without
00:13:49.800 those
00:13:50.040 kind
00:13:50.160 of
00:13:50.279 skip
00:13:50.560 connections
00:13:51.480 we
00:13:51.639 had
00:13:51.839 simply
00:13:52.240 F1
00:13:52.720 con
00:13:53.399 with
00:13:53.800 two3
00:13:54.800 in
00:13:54.920 the
00:13:55.040 So-Cal
00:13:55.519 let's
00:13:55.639 say
00:13:55.800 V
00:13:56.320 architecture
00:13:57.320 so
00:13:57.600 here
00:13:57.839 we
00:13:58.040 had
00:13:58.360 a
00:13:59.120 back
00:13:59.440 propagation
00:14:00.440 that
00:14:00.639 it
00:14:00.800 was
00:14:01.720 involving
00:14:03.079 just
00:14:03.519 a
00:14:03.639 single
00:14:04.000 trajectory
00:14:04.560 a
00:14:04.680 single
00:14:05.040 path
00:14:05.279 through
00:14:05.600 all
00:14:05.880 of
00:14:06.040 these
00:14:06.279 Gates
00:14:06.839 and
00:14:07.079 at
00:14:07.199 some
00:14:07.399 point
00:14:07.600 the
00:14:07.759 gradient
00:14:08.199 was
00:14:08.399 actually
00:14:09.040 dying
00:14:09.959 and
00:14:10.120 of
00:14:10.240 course
00:14:10.440 a
00:14:10.639 dying
00:14:11.000 gradient
00:14:11.480 means
00:14:11.920 that
00:14:12.639 specific
00:14:13.079 functionality
00:14:13.639 of
00:14:13.759 my
00:14:14.360 network
00:14:15.600 they
00:14:15.720 are
00:14:16.160 being
00:14:16.920 updated
00:14:17.399 the
00:14:17.560 parameters
00:14:18.000 are
00:14:18.160 being
00:14:18.399 updated
00:14:19.120 very
00:14:19.600 slowly
00:14:20.120 or
00:14:20.399 just
00:14:20.600 simply
00:14:20.959 seize
00:14:21.399 to
00:14:21.560 be
00:14:21.759 updated
00:14:22.320 so
00:14:22.519 that's
00:14:22.839 not
00:14:23.759 really
00:14:24.040 I
00:14:24.120 mean
00:14:24.279 this
00:14:24.360 is
00:14:24.920 one
00:14:25.040 of
00:14:25.199 the
00:14:25.320 key
00:14:25.519 observations
00:14:26.120 that
00:14:26.279 led
00:14:26.519 to
00:14:26.680 some

00:16:20.079 to
00:16:20.240 be
00:16:20.360 a

00:16:20.839 powerful
00:16:22.279 approach
00:16:23.399 in
00:16:23.600 solving
00:16:24.959 you

00:16:41.560 today
00:16:42.440 so
00:16:43.360 a
00:16:43.480 few
00:16:43.720 words
00:16:44.000 about
00:16:44.360 ample
00:16:44.880 methods
00:16:45.240 is
00:16:45.560 arguably
00:16:46.079 a
00:16:46.720 parenthesis
00:16:47.880 but
00:16:48.000 I
00:16:48.120 think
00:16:48.240 it's
00:16:48.399 a
00:16:48.600 kind
00:16:49.920 worthwhile
00:16:51.399 sort
00:16:51.639 of

00:16:52.880 about
00:16:53.199 ensample
00:16:53.800 methods
00:17:00.360 so
00:17:01.160 there
00:17:01.279 are
00:17:01.440 various
00:17:01.759 asample
00:17:02.199 methods
00:17:02.560 but
00:17:02.720 I
00:17:02.839 think
00:17:03.399 a
00:17:03.560 common
00:17:03.920 denominator
00:17:04.640 for
00:17:05.079 many

00:17:06.360 is

00:19:01.280 is
00:19:01.919 obtained
00:19:03.120 evidently
00:19:03.799 when
00:19:04.120 you're
00:19:04.880 you
00:19:05.120 have
00:19:05.520 very
00:19:06.159 correlated

00:19:08.000 and

00:19:13.760 somehow
00:19:15.280 we
00:19:15.440 are
00:19:16.000 going
00:19:16.240 to
00:19:16.559 exhibit
00:19:17.000 this

00:19:18.159 where

00:19:19.400 form
00:19:19.720 a

00:19:20.360 or
00:19:20.559 not
00:19:21.080 you
00:19:21.280 get
00:19:21.559 exactly
00:19:21.960 the
00:19:22.080 same
00:19:22.400 performance
00:19:23.400 it's
00:19:23.600 just
00:19:23.799 like
00:19:24.080 the
00:19:24.760 analogy
00:19:25.760 or
00:19:25.919 the
00:19:26.080 equivalent
00:19:26.440 analogy
00:19:26.919 I
00:19:27.000 would
00:19:27.200 like
00:19:27.400 to
00:19:28.120 sort
00:19:28.360 of
00:19:28.480 share
00:19:28.720 sh
00:19:28.960 is
00:19:29.840 you
00:19:30.000 have
00:19:30.200 a
00:19:30.400 committee
00:19:30.760 of
00:19:30.919 let's
00:19:31.080 say
00:19:31.280 a
00:19:31.440 human
00:19:33.159 Committee
00:19:33.520 of
00:19:33.679 human
00:19:34.000 experts
00:19:34.840 but
00:19:35.039 each
00:19:35.280 expert
00:19:35.640 went
00:19:35.880 to
00:19:36.159 exactly
00:19:36.520 the
00:19:36.679 same
00:19:36.919 school
00:19:37.840 studied
00:19:38.320 exactly
00:19:38.679 the
00:19:38.799 same
00:19:39.000 field
00:19:39.600 had
00:19:39.960 exactly
00:19:40.360 the
00:19:40.480 same
00:19:41.600 University
00:19:42.280 professors
00:19:42.960 and
00:19:43.200 they
00:19:43.360 are
00:19:43.640 actually
00:19:44.000 now
00:19:44.320 called
00:19:44.679 to
00:19:44.840 solve
00:19:45.200 the
00:19:45.520 problem
00:19:46.520 and
00:19:47.000 guess
00:19:47.240 what
00:19:47.480 each
00:19:47.679 one
00:19:47.880 of
00:19:48.039 them
00:19:48.200 is
00:19:48.360 actually
00:19:48.640 offering
00:19:49.120 exactly
00:19:49.520 the
00:19:49.640 same
00:19:49.880 view
00:19:50.720 well
00:19:50.960 that's
00:19:51.200 basically
00:19:51.640 where
00:19:51.880 the
00:19:52.080 point
00:19:52.320 where
00:19:52.480 you
00:19:52.720 experiencing
00:19:53.240 a
00:19:53.360 lower
00:19:53.760 performance
00:19:54.320 bound
00:19:55.320 and
00:19:55.480 the
00:19:55.600 upper
00:19:56.000 performance
00:19:56.440 bound
00:19:56.720 is
00:19:56.840 a
00:19:57.000 bit
00:19:57.200 more
00:19:58.120 nuanced
00:19:58.760 a
00:19:58.880 bit
00:19:59.039 more
00:19:59.280 complicated
00:20:00.080 to
00:20:00.520 kind
00:20:00.679 of
00:20:01.240 understand
00:20:01.760 but
00:20:02.200 the
00:20:03.200 best
00:20:04.120 performance
00:20:05.480 what
00:20:05.640 we
00:20:05.799 can
00:20:06.039 actually
00:20:06.919 get
00:20:08.600 I
00:20:08.679 think
00:20:08.840 it's
00:20:09.000 better
00:20:09.240 understood
00:20:09.679 with
00:20:09.799 an
00:20:10.240 analogy
00:20:11.440 you
00:20:11.559 don't
00:20:11.919 expect
00:20:12.520 every
00:20:13.000 Committee
00:20:13.480 Member
00:20:13.840 to
00:20:14.000 not
00:20:14.240 make
00:20:14.679 mistakes
00:20:15.200 they
00:20:15.360 will
00:20:15.679 make
00:20:16.000 mistakes
00:20:17.000 but
00:20:17.960 what
00:20:18.080 you
00:20:18.240 want
00:20:18.400 to
00:20:18.600 do
00:20:19.120 is
00:20:19.360 to
00:20:20.240 have
00:20:20.440 a
00:20:20.640 committee
00:20:21.080 that
00:20:21.280 they
00:20:21.440 don't
00:20:21.720 make
00:20:22.039 the
00:20:22.159 same
00:20:22.440 mistake
00:20:22.919 at
00:20:23.080 the
00:20:23.240 same
00:20:23.679 time
00:20:24.679 so
00:20:24.880 the
00:20:26.240 uncorrelated
00:20:27.440 errors
00:20:28.159 are
00:20:28.919 involved
00:20:29.440 in
00:20:30.520 sort
00:20:30.720 of
00:20:30.880 show
00:20:31.280 showing
00:20:32.000 some
00:20:32.200 kind
00:20:32.360 of
00:20:32.480 a
00:20:32.600 performance
00:20:33.080 bound
00:20:33.480 that
00:20:33.840 is
00:20:34.000 kind
00:20:34.120 of
00:20:34.280 outside
00:20:34.679 of
00:20:34.840 the
00:20:34.960 scope
00:20:35.720 of
00:20:35.919 this
00:20:36.080 course
00:20:36.480 but
00:20:37.480 I
00:20:37.559 think
00:20:37.720 it's
00:20:37.919 worthwhile
00:20:39.760 providing
00:20:40.280 some
00:20:40.559 kind
00:20:40.679 of
00:20:41.000 guidance
00:20:41.520 as
00:20:41.720 to
00:20:42.159 where
00:20:42.880 and
00:20:43.159 how
00:20:43.360 we
00:20:43.480 will
00:20:43.720 be
00:20:43.880 able
00:20:44.120 to
00:20:44.320 achieve
00:20:44.720 that
00:20:44.919 upper
00:20:45.280 bound
00:20:46.400 so
00:20:46.640 the
00:20:47.280 main
00:20:47.600 three
00:20:47.880 ways
00:20:48.159 that
00:20:48.320 we
00:20:48.440 can
00:20:48.640 achieve
00:20:49.000 this
00:20:49.200 kind
00:20:49.360 of
00:20:49.520 upper
00:20:49.799 bound
00:20:50.080 or
00:20:50.280 try
00:20:50.520 to
00:20:50.720 achieve
00:20:51.080 the
00:20:51.559 best
00:20:51.880 possible
00:20:52.679 performance
00:20:53.120 out
00:20:53.320 of
00:20:53.520 ample
00:20:54.000 methods
00:20:54.799 the
00:20:55.039 first
00:20:55.919 is
00:20:56.919 the
00:20:57.120 data
00:20:57.520 component
00:20:58.080 can
00:20:58.280 we
00:20:59.960 provide
00:21:00.799 in
00:21:01.240 some
00:21:01.559 way
00:21:02.559 different
00:21:03.200 data
00:21:03.720 to
00:21:04.039 different
00:21:04.640 of
00:21:05.480 to
00:21:05.720 the
00:21:06.080 various
00:21:06.440 kind
00:21:06.640 of
00:21:06.760 weak
00:21:06.960 predictors
00:21:07.440 that
00:21:07.600 we
00:21:07.799 have
00:21:08.080 here
00:21:08.799 so
00:21:09.000 that
00:21:09.200 we
00:21:09.360 do
00:21:09.559 not
00:21:10.200 cause
00:21:11.440 exactly
00:21:11.880 the

00:21:13.200 for

00:21:13.720 one
00:21:13.880 of
00:21:14.080 them
00:21:14.360 so
00:21:14.760 the
00:21:15.840 second
00:21:16.840 is
00:21:17.600 to

00:21:18.919 randomize
00:21:19.559 their
00:21:20.200 operation
00:21:27.279 randomization
00:21:28.279 is
00:21:29.520 the
00:21:29.679 second
00:21:30.240 kind
00:21:30.400 of
00:21:30.640 approach
00:21:31.120 there
00:21:31.679 and
00:21:31.799 I
00:21:31.960 can
00:21:32.159 actually
00:21:32.480 can
00:21:32.679 offer
00:21:32.960 an
00:21:33.159 example
00:21:33.520 of
00:21:34.240 randomization
00:21:35.240 maybe
00:21:35.559 we
00:21:35.679 can
00:21:35.919 actually
00:21:36.240 offer
00:21:36.760 a

00:21:38.919 of

00:21:40.840 sort
00:21:41.080 of
00:21:41.760 picked
00:21:42.240 by
00:21:42.480 some
00:21:42.760 kind
00:21:42.919 of
00:21:43.720 distribution
00:21:44.919 in
00:21:45.159 this
00:21:45.799 architecture
00:21:46.799 see
00:21:47.440 over
00:21:47.919 here
00:21:49.200 in
00:21:49.640 this
00:21:49.840 course
00:21:50.600 u
00:21:50.720 in
00:21:50.919 some
00:21:51.159 other
00:21:51.600 approaches
00:21:52.159 where
00:21:52.360 we
00:21:52.559 have
00:21:52.760 let's
00:21:53.000 say
00:21:54.000 decision
00:21:54.440 trees
00:21:54.880 involved
00:21:55.279 in
00:21:55.440 these
00:21:55.799 predictors
00:21:56.400 again
00:21:56.600 for
00:21:56.840 structure
00:21:57.279 data
00:21:57.520 I'm
00:21:57.679 referring
00:21:58.080 to
00:21:58.799 then
00:21:59.000 we
00:21:59.120 can
00:21:59.320 randomize
00:21:59.919 their
00:22:00.360 operation
00:22:01.000 by
00:22:01.200 picking
00:22:01.679 different
00:22:02.559 features
00:22:03.000 that
00:22:03.159 they
00:22:03.360 split
00:22:04.520 their
00:22:05.559 sort
00:22:05.799 of
00:22:06.200 trees
00:22:07.200 and
00:22:07.400 there
00:22:07.520 are
00:22:07.679 so
00:22:07.840 many
00:22:08.159 approaches
00:22:08.640 that
00:22:08.799 are
00:22:09.240 you
00:22:09.400 know
00:22:10.000 I
00:22:10.120 guess
00:22:10.320 too
00:22:10.520 many
00:22:10.760 to
00:22:11.320 quote
00:22:11.720 over
00:22:12.000 here
00:22:12.520 but
00:22:12.640 the
00:22:12.799 third
00:22:13.120 approach
00:22:13.480 is
00:22:13.640 a
00:22:13.760 bit
00:22:13.919 more
00:22:14.120 relevant
00:22:14.720 in
00:22:14.880 this
00:22:15.120 specific
00:22:15.520 rest
00:22:15.919 not
00:22:16.080 architecture
00:22:16.679 is
00:22:16.840 to
00:22:17.480 Simply
00:22:17.919 use
00:22:18.559 different
00:22:25.480 predictors
00:22:26.480 or
00:22:26.919 weak
00:22:27.240 learners
00:22:32.159 so
00:22:32.400 the
00:22:32.559 weak
00:22:32.799 Learners
00:22:33.240 that
00:22:33.400 we
00:22:33.559 called
00:22:33.840 over
00:22:34.159 here
00:22:34.880 are
00:22:35.919 involved
00:22:36.600 in
00:22:36.760 the
00:22:36.919 rest
00:22:37.240 net
00:22:37.440 architecture
00:22:38.440 and
00:22:39.720 so
00:22:40.720 here
00:22:40.919 we
00:22:41.120 have
00:22:41.240 a
00:22:41.440 predictor
00:22:41.919 of
00:22:42.080 some
00:22:42.679 complexity
00:22:43.679 we
00:22:43.840 have
00:22:44.039 here
00:22:44.240 another
00:22:46.200 predictor
00:22:47.200 larger
00:22:47.679 complexity
00:22:48.679 and
00:22:48.919 yet
00:22:49.120 another
00:22:49.480 predictor
00:22:50.120 or
00:22:50.360 even
00:22:51.120 larger
00:22:51.559 complexity
00:22:52.120 we
00:22:52.279 have
00:22:53.200 effectively
00:22:54.360 implementing
00:22:55.919 you
00:22:56.039 know
00:22:56.200 the
00:22:56.360 third
00:22:56.720 approach
00:22:57.120 where
00:22:57.279 we
00:22:57.520 have
00:22:59.200 those
00:22:59.679 different
00:23:00.520 week
00:23:00.840 Learners
00:23:01.400 each
00:23:01.559 one
00:23:01.760 is
00:23:01.919 offering
00:23:02.320 a
00:23:02.520 view
00:23:03.400 and
00:23:03.600 then
00:23:04.559 finally
00:23:04.960 the
00:23:05.120 network
00:23:05.600 is
00:23:05.840 deciding
00:23:06.360 based
00:23:06.640 on
00:23:06.760 the
00:23:06.960 composition
00:23:07.520 of
00:23:07.720 those
00:23:07.919 views
00:23:08.760 okay
00:23:08.960 so
00:23:09.720 that
00:23:10.080 has
00:23:10.240 been
00:23:10.360 shown
00:23:10.919 to
00:23:12.320 sort
00:23:12.559 of
00:23:13.000 provide
00:23:13.640 performance
00:23:14.080 advantages
00:23:14.799 and
00:23:15.480 that's
00:23:15.679 what
00:23:15.960 we
00:23:16.679 kind
00:23:16.840 of
00:23:17.000 had
00:23:17.200 this
00:23:17.400 discussion
00:23:17.880 about
00:23:18.159 and
00:23:18.400 Sample
00:23:18.760 methods
00:23:19.679 and
00:23:19.799 the
00:23:20.000 third
00:23:20.760 kind
00:23:20.919 of
00:23:21.159 Advantage
00:23:21.640 I
00:23:21.760 wanted
00:23:22.039 to
00:23:22.720 quote
00:23:23.080 here
00:23:23.279 for
00:23:23.600 rest
00:23:23.840 n
00:23:24.080 is
00:23:24.279 there
00:23:24.520 scalability
00:23:29.600 so
00:23:29.840 the
00:23:30.760 scalability
00:23:32.039 should
00:23:32.279 be
00:23:32.480 understood
00:23:32.960 from
00:23:33.159 the
00:23:33.400 point
00:23:33.600 of
00:23:33.760 view
00:23:34.080 of
00:23:35.679 complexity
00:23:37.080 we
00:23:37.240 are
00:23:37.919 effectively
00:23:38.440 able
00:23:38.760 to
00:23:39.679 have
00:23:40.080 three
00:23:40.520 six
00:23:40.919 n
00:23:41.240 or
00:23:41.400 whatever
00:23:41.960 number
00:23:42.480 of
00:23:43.039 residual
00:23:43.559 blocks
00:23:44.000 each
00:23:44.200 one
00:23:44.480 of
00:23:44.640 them
00:23:44.840 will
00:23:45.039 actually
00:23:45.440 be
00:23:46.640 exactly
00:23:47.080 the
00:23:47.400 same
00:23:48.960 as
00:23:49.880 you
00:23:50.000 know
00:23:50.200 any
00:23:50.400 other
00:23:50.640 block
00:23:51.000 over
00:23:51.279 here
00:23:52.080 and
00:23:52.279 therefore
00:23:52.760 we
00:23:52.840 are
00:23:53.039 able
00:23:53.320 to
00:23:56.000 architectures
00:23:57.000 that
00:23:57.320 are
00:23:57.640 have
00:23:57.960 various
00:23:59.960 number
00:24:00.279 of
00:24:00.480 these
00:24:00.640 blocks
00:24:01.039 let's
00:24:01.240 say
00:24:01.760 we
00:24:01.880 see
00:24:02.640 resets
00:24:03.240 with
00:24:03.400 18
00:24:03.880 layers
00:24:04.880 34
00:24:05.559 layers
00:24:06.480 you
00:24:06.600 know
00:24:06.840 50
00:24:07.640 layers
00:24:09.080 150
00:24:10.640 102
00:24:11.919 layers
00:24:12.919 even
00:24:13.360 150
00:24:14.240 layers
00:24:15.240 these
00:24:15.360 are
00:24:15.559 the
00:24:15.760 numbers
00:24:16.159 that
00:24:16.400 we
00:24:16.600 have
00:24:17.640 we
00:24:17.760 have
00:24:18.000 defined
00:24:18.400 already
00:24:18.799 existing
00:24:19.240 architectures
00:24:19.960 and
00:24:20.120 this
00:24:20.240 is
00:24:20.400 kind
00:24:20.559 of
00:24:20.760 important
00:24:21.679 when
00:24:21.880 you
00:24:22.080 have
00:24:22.440 perception
00:24:23.279 systems
00:24:23.880 that
00:24:24.240 need
00:24:24.440 to
00:24:24.640 comply
00:24:25.039 to
00:24:25.240 some
00:24:25.880 realtime
00:24:26.520 latency
00:24:27.120 requirement
00:24:27.720 evidently
00:24:28.159 the
00:24:28.440 larger
00:24:28.720 the
00:24:28.840 number
00:24:29.039 of
00:24:29.200 layers
00:24:29.520 you
00:24:29.679 have
00:24:30.480 the
00:24:31.080 longer
00:24:31.600 the
00:24:31.919 latencies
00:24:32.919 that
00:24:33.080 you
00:24:33.240 are
00:24:33.480 going
00:24:33.679 to
00:24:34.679 experience
00:24:35.679 taking
00:24:36.039 an
00:24:36.279 image
00:24:36.600 through
00:24:36.880 this
00:24:37.080 kind
00:24:37.240 of
00:24:37.559 pipeline
00:24:38.559 so
00:24:39.440 if
00:24:39.640 we
00:24:40.960 have
00:24:41.200 let's
00:24:41.320 say
00:24:41.440 a
00:24:41.679 latency
00:24:42.679 of
00:24:43.200 let's
00:24:43.399 say
00:24:44.760 MCS
00:24:45.960 we
00:24:46.360 can
00:24:47.640 and
00:24:48.039 therefore
00:24:48.360 we
00:24:48.440 are
00:24:48.559 not
00:24:48.720 able
00:24:48.919 to
00:24:49.080 accommodate
00:24:49.880 102
00:24:51.640 layers
00:24:52.039 where
00:24:52.480 definitely
00:24:52.840 going
00:24:52.960 to
00:24:53.080 be
00:24:53.279 accommodating
00:24:53.919 let's
00:24:54.080 say
00:24:54.240 50
00:24:54.600 layers
00:24:55.559 and
00:24:56.200 the
00:24:57.000 exactly
00:24:57.399 the
00:24:57.559 same
00:24:57.799 technology
00:24:58.440 exactly
00:24:58.840 the
00:24:59.120 same
00:25:00.320 thinking
00:25:01.520 and
00:25:01.760 behavior
00:25:02.279 of
00:25:02.440 rest
00:25:02.840 Nets
00:25:03.200 will
00:25:03.960 be
00:25:04.320 in
00:25:04.679 either
00:25:05.000 of
00:25:05.200 the
00:25:06.440 numbers
00:25:06.840 quoted
00:25:07.320 here
00:25:07.440 in

00:25:07.760 of
00:25:07.919 number
00:25:08.159 of
00:25:08.320 layers
00:25:09.000 so
00:25:09.200 all
00:25:09.360 of
00:25:09.520 these
00:25:09.679 three

00:25:10.480 are
00:25:10.679 coming
00:25:11.200 together
00:25:12.080 to
00:25:12.480 provide
00:25:12.840 a
00:25:13.000 fairly
00:25:13.399 robust
00:25:13.840 architecture
00:25:14.480 has
00:25:14.679 actually
00:25:14.919 proven
00:25:15.279 in
00:25:15.399 the
00:25:15.559 field
00:25:16.520 in
00:25:16.960 both
00:25:17.200 real

00:25:18.480 applications
00:25:19.279 and

00:25:21.520 extract
00:25:22.640 features
00:25:23.200 provide
