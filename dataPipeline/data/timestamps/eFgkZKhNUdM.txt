00:00:03.840 we
00:00:03.959 are
00:00:04.040 in
00:00:04.160 the
00:00:04.359 trajectory
00:00:05.000 where
00:00:05.200 we
00:00:05.319 are
00:00:05.600 going
00:00:05.839 to
00:00:06.279 obtain

00:00:10.040 binary
00:00:10.440 classifier
00:00:11.160 that

00:00:12.440 before
00:00:12.719 we
00:00:12.840 do
00:00:13.040 so
00:00:13.280 I
00:00:13.360 think
00:00:13.480 it's
00:00:14.200 worthwhile
00:00:15.200 kind
00:00:15.360 of
00:00:15.480 thinking
00:00:15.759 a
00:00:15.920 bit
00:00:16.160 about
00:00:17.039 the

00:00:18.880 are
00:00:19.359 present
00:00:20.359 in
00:00:20.600 the

00:00:22.880 models
00:00:24.119 that
00:00:24.279 will
00:00:24.519 give
00:00:24.680 us
00:00:24.840 the

00:00:25.960 of
00:00:26.160 this
00:00:26.519 binary
00:00:27.080 classifier
00:00:28.080 so
00:00:28.400 in
00:00:28.519 general
00:00:28.840 there
00:00:28.960 are
00:00:29.119 two
00:00:29.320 Frameworks
00:00:30.080 the
00:00:30.320 first
00:00:36.040 one
00:00:37.040 both
00:00:37.239 of
00:00:37.360 these
00:00:37.520 Frameworks
00:00:38.000 involve
00:00:38.399 the

00:00:39.040 probability
00:00:39.640 but
00:00:39.760 in
00:00:39.920 a

00:00:40.200 of
00:00:40.320 a
00:00:40.520 different
00:00:40.960 way
00:00:41.719 so
00:00:41.920 the
00:00:42.079 first
00:00:42.320 framework
00:00:42.960 is
00:00:44.200 called

00:00:53.199 is
00:00:58.160 generate
00:00:59.160 and
00:00:59.280 the

00:00:59.640 between
00:00:59.840 the

00:01:00.239 is
00:01:00.359 quite
00:01:00.600 important
00:01:01.320 and
00:01:01.879 they
00:01:02.000 are
00:01:02.239 although
00:01:02.559 they
00:01:02.800 both
00:01:03.960 effectively
00:01:04.680 are

00:01:08.320 at
00:01:08.520 the
00:01:09.040 posterior
00:01:10.159 let
00:01:10.360 me
00:01:10.600 call
00:01:10.920 this

00:01:13.520 K
00:01:14.320 given
00:01:16.520 X
00:01:17.520 which
00:01:17.720 as
00:01:17.880 we
00:01:18.000 have
00:01:18.119 seen
00:01:18.320 in
00:01:18.439 the

00:01:19.159 review
00:01:20.280 section
00:01:20.759 this
00:01:22.400 is
00:01:23.400 the

00:01:25.680 given
00:01:26.680 YK

00:01:38.240 ofx
00:01:39.240 so
00:01:39.439 this
00:01:39.560 is
00:01:39.680 the

00:01:42.280 as

00:01:42.560 will
00:01:42.759 see
00:01:43.479 kind
00:01:43.680 of

00:01:44.159 it
00:01:44.320 a
00:01:44.479 bit
00:01:45.159 differently
00:01:46.159 so
00:01:46.399 the
00:01:46.719 discriminative
00:01:49.520 framework
00:01:50.119 we
00:01:50.240 will

00:01:58.000 is
00:01:58.200 the

00:01:58.600 that
00:01:58.759 will
00:01:59.000 involve
00:01:59.439 Direct
00:01:59.960 modeling
00:02:00.320 of
00:02:00.439 the

00:02:01.200 so
00:02:01.399 the
00:02:01.560 discriminative
00:02:02.360 I
00:02:02.600 call
00:02:02.799 it
00:02:03.520 the

00:02:05.280 and
00:02:05.439 the
00:02:05.600 second
00:02:05.960 framework
00:02:06.960 so
00:02:07.159 the
00:02:07.320 first
00:02:08.479 framework
00:02:09.479 so
00:02:17.280 methods
00:02:20.920 model
00:02:21.920 the
00:02:24.200 posterior
00:02:25.200 directly
00:02:31.440 so
00:02:31.599 we
00:02:31.760 get
00:02:32.080 this
00:02:33.160 posterior

00:02:35.239 diagram
00:02:35.959 itself
00:02:36.959 and

00:02:37.440 the
00:02:37.599 generative
00:02:38.280 ones
00:02:38.800 are
00:02:39.360 effectively
00:02:40.200 model
00:02:41.200 the

00:02:43.840 kind
00:02:43.959 of

00:02:45.319 so
00:02:45.519 we'll
00:02:45.920 first
00:02:46.319 deal
00:02:46.680 with
00:02:46.840 the

00:02:47.959 discriminative
00:02:49.120 classifiers
00:02:50.040 and
00:02:50.159 I
00:02:50.239 want
00:02:50.480 to
00:02:51.640 connect
00:02:53.239 the
00:02:54.560 earlier
00:02:55.080 discussion
00:02:55.560 we
00:02:55.760 had

00:02:58.720 of
00:02:58.879 video
00:02:59.120 we
00:02:59.239 have
00:02:59.400 introduced
00:03:00.040 a
00:03:00.239 problem
00:03:00.680 where
00:03:01.760 we
00:03:02.000 had
00:03:04.159 we
00:03:04.360 actually
00:03:04.640 went
00:03:04.879 and
00:03:05.080 Drew
00:03:05.959 all
00:03:06.319 the

00:03:12.400 of
00:03:12.560 mistake
00:03:13.360 so
00:03:13.519 I
00:03:13.599 want
00:03:13.720 to
00:03:13.840 flip
00:03:14.159 the
00:03:14.280 coin
00:03:14.599 now
00:03:14.799 and
00:03:15.040 actually
00:03:15.720 H
00:03:16.720 sort
00:03:16.959 of

00:03:22.040 but
00:03:22.840 the

00:03:23.640 when

00:03:29.879 imize

00:04:41.320 this

00:05:01.880 that
00:05:02.039 will
00:05:02.240 actually
00:05:02.479 be
00:05:03.240 helpful
00:05:04.440 which
00:05:04.600 is
00:05:05.120 of
00:05:05.280 course
00:05:05.560 equal
00:05:06.320 to
00:05:07.320 a

00:05:09.320 in

00:05:10.680 for
00:05:11.440 this
00:05:11.560 is
00:05:11.720 now
00:05:12.000 the
00:05:12.280 general
00:05:13.400 case
00:05:13.720 where
00:05:13.880 we
00:05:14.080 have
00:05:16.120 Capital
00:05:17.120 One
00:05:17.759 to
00:05:18.440 capital
00:05:18.880 K
00:05:19.880 in

00:05:20.199 specific
00:05:20.639 capital
00:05:21.039 K
00:05:21.240 is
00:05:21.400 equal
00:05:21.680 to
00:05:22.680 two
00:05:23.880 but
00:05:24.240 this
00:05:24.400 formula
00:05:24.880 that
00:05:25.000 I'm
00:05:25.400 actually
00:05:25.639 writing
00:05:26.080 here
00:05:26.199 is
00:05:26.319 going
00:05:26.440 to
00:05:26.560 be
00:05:26.680 general
00:05:26.960 for

00:05:27.520 K
00:05:28.319 classes
00:05:29.440 or
00:05:29.759 of
00:05:29.919 the
00:05:30.120 integral
00:05:30.680 over
00:05:30.960 the
00:05:33.479 RK
00:05:34.479 of
00:05:34.759 the
00:05:35.680 so
00:05:35.840 I'm
00:05:36.039 replacing
00:05:36.479 the
00:05:36.680 joint
00:05:37.039 with
00:05:37.160 the

00:05:38.479 times
00:05:39.000 the
00:05:44.479 marginal
00:05:45.479 and
00:05:45.960 now
00:05:46.120 it's
00:05:46.360 actually
00:05:46.720 a
00:05:46.840 bit
00:05:47.840 more
00:05:48.240 evident
00:05:49.319 how
00:05:50.680 maximizing
00:05:51.479 P
00:05:54.080 effectively
00:05:55.720 involves
00:05:57.240 maximizing
00:05:58.240 the
00:05:58.479 posterior
00:05:59.319 because
00:06:00.479 this
00:06:00.680 term
00:06:01.000 over
00:06:01.800 here
00:06:02.800 is
00:06:10.880 independent
00:06:11.880 of
00:06:12.120 the
00:06:16.639 assignment
00:06:17.639 of
00:06:21.440 to
00:06:22.440 the
00:06:27.000 YK
00:06:28.000 so
00:06:28.199 now
00:06:28.400 we
00:06:28.520 have
00:06:28.759 connected
00:06:29.360 the
00:06:30.919 direct
00:06:31.240 connection
00:06:31.800 effectively
00:06:32.400 that
00:06:32.800 of
00:06:33.000 the
00:06:33.160 probability
00:06:33.599 of
00:06:33.759 being
00:06:34.000 correct
00:06:35.000 and
00:06:35.319 the
00:06:35.919 maximization
00:06:36.759 trying
00:06:36.960 to
00:06:37.120 maximize
00:06:37.560 the
00:06:37.639 probability
00:06:37.960 of
00:06:38.039 being
00:06:38.240 correct
00:06:38.880 effectively
00:06:39.319 means
00:06:39.599 maximizing
00:06:40.520 the
00:06:40.720 posterior
00:06:41.199 probability
00:06:41.720 so
00:06:41.880 let
00:06:42.000 me
00:06:42.240 write
00:06:43.039 that
00:06:43.199 down
00:06:43.440 because
00:06:43.680 it's
00:06:43.840 kind
00:06:43.960 of
00:06:46.880 maximizing
00:06:47.880 P
00:06:50.680 correct
00:06:51.680 is
00:06:51.919 equivalent
00:06:52.440 to
00:06:53.520 maximizing
00:06:54.520 P
00:06:54.800 of

00:06:55.440 k
00:06:56.440 YK
00:06:57.440 given
00:06:57.800 X
00:07:01.919 effectively
00:07:06.479 this
00:07:06.680 points
00:07:07.000 to
00:07:07.120 the

00:07:15.960 we
00:07:16.080 will
00:07:16.240 see
00:07:16.560 here
00:07:17.360 we'll
00:07:17.599 see
00:07:17.879 something
00:07:18.280 like
00:07:19.360 that
00:07:20.360 let's

00:08:11.000 it
00:08:12.720 will
00:08:13.720 look

00:09:13.519 let's
00:09:13.760 say
00:09:14.000 x
00:09:14.320 new
00:09:14.959 that
00:09:15.160 we

00:09:22.800 I
00:09:23.120 actually
00:09:23.440 we
00:09:23.560 can
00:09:23.760 actually
00:09:24.000 see
00:09:24.360 here
00:09:25.120 that

00:15:52.759 let's
00:15:53.120 say
00:15:54.079 a

00:16:02.319 kind
00:16:02.440 of
00:16:05.560 then
00:16:06.560 this

00:16:28.519 binary
00:16:29.519 classification
00:16:30.519 so
00:16:30.839 effectively
00:16:31.480 over

00:21:48.880 it's
00:21:49.120 Al
00:21:49.440 also

00:21:59.039 if

00:22:20.400 let's
00:22:20.559 say

00:22:22.440 and

00:22:38.880 mostly
00:22:39.320 we

00:22:45.679 we're
00:22:45.799 going

00:22:48.640 here
00:22:48.799 we're
00:22:49.000 actually
00:22:49.240 plotting
00:22:49.679 here
00:22:49.960 the

00:22:51.760 truths
00:22:52.760 and
00:22:53.480 if
00:22:53.600 we
00:22:53.760 are
00:22:53.960 to
00:22:54.640 if
00:22:54.760 we
00:22:54.919 are
00:22:55.120 to
00:22:57.080 do
00:22:57.559 regression
00:22:58.520 to
00:22:58.640 fit
00:22:59.000 this
00:22:59.279 data
00:22:59.960 in
00:23:00.120 a
00:23:00.320 very
00:23:00.480 similar
00:23:00.880 way
00:23:01.080 as
00:23:01.240 we
00:23:01.360 have
00:23:01.559 done
00:23:01.960 earlier
00:23:02.880 probably
00:23:03.279 will
00:23:03.480 come
00:23:03.640 up
00:23:03.880 with
00:23:04.080 a
00:23:04.640 kind
00:23:04.799 of
00:23:04.880 a
00:23:05.039 straight
00:23:05.720 line
00:23:06.720 that
00:23:07.080 tries
00:23:07.640 to
00:23:08.840 maximize
00:23:09.400 some

00:23:10.120 kind
00:23:10.320 of
00:23:10.480 function
00:23:10.960 so
00:23:11.200 this
00:23:11.320 is
00:23:13.480 straight
00:23:13.919 line
00:23:14.520 regression
00:23:15.000 is
00:23:15.159 not
00:23:15.400 going
00:23:15.600 to
00:23:15.760 be
00:23:15.960 very
00:23:16.200 appropriate
00:23:16.640 for
00:23:16.760 a
00:23:16.919 classification
00:23:17.640 problem
00:23:18.000 because
00:23:18.279 we
00:23:18.400 are
00:23:18.600 expecting
00:23:19.600 our
00:23:19.919 predictor
00:23:20.520 to
00:23:21.320 produce
00:23:21.880 values
00:23:22.320 always
00:23:22.760 between
00:23:23.120 zero
00:23:23.400 and
00:23:23.600 one
00:23:24.279 so
00:23:24.480 therefore
00:23:24.880 what
00:23:25.000 we
00:23:25.159 do
00:23:25.440 here
00:23:25.679 is
00:23:25.919 we
00:23:26.080 are
00:23:26.720 applying
00:23:27.159 the
00:23:27.279 sigmoidal
00:23:28.039 so
00:23:28.200 this
00:23:28.320 is
00:23:28.919 effectively
00:23:29.400 the
00:23:29.520 line
00:23:29.760 that
00:23:29.919 generates
00:23:30.559 the
00:23:31.799 a
00:23:32.919 when
00:23:33.080 we
00:23:33.240 have
00:23:33.440 no
00:23:33.640 features
00:23:34.240 no
00:23:34.400 featurization
00:23:34.919 in
00:23:35.400 this
00:23:35.600 specific
00:23:35.960 Syle
00:23:36.559 example
00:23:37.559 and
00:23:37.679 so
00:23:37.919 the
00:23:38.039 sigmoidal
00:23:38.679 unit
00:23:39.039 will
00:23:39.840 match
00:23:41.279 effectively
00:23:42.279 the
00:23:43.880 it
00:23:44.039 has
00:23:44.159 a
00:23:44.279 linear
00:23:44.760 component
00:23:45.279 over
00:23:45.600 here
00:23:46.520 and
00:23:46.919 will
00:23:47.200 compress
00:23:47.799 everything
00:23:48.559 between
00:23:49.080 zero
00:23:49.400 and
00:23:49.600 one
00:23:49.840 so
00:23:50.039 that's
00:23:50.240 another
00:23:50.600 way
00:23:50.799 of
00:23:51.679 kind
00:23:51.880 of
00:23:52.320 graphically
00:23:53.440 remembering
00:23:54.039 logistic
00:23:54.640 regression
00:23:55.279 as
00:23:55.440 an

00:23:57.440 but
00:23:58.640 at
00:23:58.760 the
00:23:58.880 same
00:23:59.159 time
00:23:59.400 with
00:23:59.559 a
00:23:59.760 kind
00:23:59.919 of
00:24:00.039 a
00:24:00.200 compressive
00:24:01.760 step
00:24:02.760 okay
00:24:02.960 so
00:24:03.559 now
00:24:03.840 what
00:24:04.000 we
00:24:04.120 will
00:24:04.559 do
00:24:04.720 to
00:24:04.919 conclude
00:24:05.440 a
00:24:05.559 little
00:24:05.760 bit
00:24:05.919 the
00:24:06.080 topic
00:24:07.000 of
00:24:07.400 classification
00:24:08.200 is
00:24:08.360 to
00:24:08.640 just
00:24:09.279 in
00:24:09.600 passing
00:24:10.279 quote
00:24:10.600 a
00:24:10.720 couple
00:24:10.960 of
00:24:11.080 things
00:24:11.360 about
00:24:11.679 the
00:24:11.799 second
00:24:12.200 framework
00:24:12.760 that
00:24:12.880 I
00:24:13.000 have
00:24:13.200 mentioned
00:24:14.240 the
00:24:14.400 soal
00:24:14.880 generative
00:24:15.480 classification
00:24:18.000 Frameworks
00:24:19.000 in
00:24:19.080 the
00:24:19.200 generative
00:24:19.679 classification
00:24:20.279 framework
00:24:20.799 we're
00:24:21.000 again
00:24:21.360 going
00:24:21.600 to
00:24:21.799 be
00:24:22.480 task
00:24:22.840 to
00:24:23.000 calculate
00:24:23.919 the
00:24:25.000 posterior
00:24:26.159 probability
00:24:31.000 that
00:24:31.200 we
00:24:31.399 see
00:24:32.840 here
00:24:33.840 for
00:24:34.080 in
00:24:34.279 general
00:24:34.640 kind
00:24:34.840 of
00:24:35.279 K
00:24:36.159 glasses
00:24:37.159 and
00:24:37.679 this
00:24:39.960 posterior
00:24:40.960 is
00:24:41.159 going
00:24:41.399 to
00:24:42.240 be
00:24:43.240 evidently
00:24:43.840 given
00:24:44.200 by
00:24:45.200 this
00:24:45.440 General
00:24:45.799 kind
00:24:52.720 formula
00:24:53.720 so
00:24:53.880 in
00:24:54.000 the
00:24:54.120 generative
00:24:54.720 approach
00:24:55.080 we
00:24:55.200 will
00:24:55.399 do
00:24:55.840 two
00:24:56.080 steps
00:24:56.600 instead
00:24:56.880 of
00:24:57.799 coming
00:24:58.039 up
00:24:58.200 with
00:24:58.399 the
00:24:58.520 block
00:24:58.760 diagram
00:24:59.200 that
00:24:59.399 generates
00:25:00.279 that
00:25:01.520 from
00:25:02.559 directly
00:25:03.559 and
00:25:03.760 models
00:25:04.200 the
00:25:04.360 posterior
00:25:04.880 directly
00:25:05.679 as
00:25:05.799 we
00:25:05.960 have
00:25:06.120 done
00:25:06.520 with
00:25:07.080 logistic
00:25:07.720 aggression
00:25:08.720 we
00:25:08.880 will
00:25:09.600 first
00:25:10.399 do
00:25:10.640 two
00:25:10.840 steps
00:25:11.279 one
00:25:11.559 is
00:25:11.679 to
00:25:15.919 estimate
00:25:17.159 the
00:25:22.159 likelihood
00:25:23.159 and
00:25:23.399 the
00:25:23.600 second
00:25:24.240 is
00:25:24.840 to
00:25:25.840 estimate
00:25:33.120 marginal
00:25:34.120 and
00:25:35.080 then
00:25:36.080 come
00:25:36.640 to
00:25:36.919 some
00:25:37.279 degree
00:25:37.679 of
00:25:38.080 approximation
00:25:39.080 because
00:25:39.320 it's
00:25:39.799 actually
00:25:40.399 typically
00:25:40.760 a
00:25:40.919 very
00:25:41.799 expensive
00:25:43.000 for
00:25:43.399 large
00:25:43.799 dimensions
00:25:44.720 for
00:25:49.440 Gen
00:25:50.440 this
00:25:50.720 is
00:25:53.120 a
00:25:53.320 very
00:25:55.279 expensive
00:25:56.279 calculation
00:25:59.960 so
00:26:00.279 for
00:26:00.919 we
00:26:01.039 will
00:26:01.320 typically
00:26:01.919 involve
00:26:02.320 some
00:26:02.480 form
00:26:02.720 of
00:26:03.640 approximation
00:26:04.799 for
00:26:05.120 calculating
00:26:05.840 this
00:26:06.320 denominator
00:26:06.960 over
00:26:07.200 here
00:26:07.360 of
00:26:07.559 the
00:26:10.159 posterior
00:26:11.159 the
00:26:11.320 knife
00:26:13.840 base
00:26:14.840 is
00:26:15.120 a
00:26:16.080 famous
00:26:17.399 generative
00:26:19.240 classification
00:26:20.440 method
00:26:21.440 and
00:26:21.840 we
00:26:22.000 actually
00:26:22.320 going
00:26:22.440 to
00:26:22.600 see
00:26:22.880 that
00:26:23.559 when
00:26:23.720 we
00:26:23.919 come
00:26:24.200 to
00:26:25.080 language
00:26:25.520 modeling
00:26:25.960 and
00:26:26.120 some
00:26:26.320 other
00:26:26.640 tasks
00:26:27.640 later
00:26:27.880 on
00:26:28.039 in
00:26:28.320 some
00:26:28.559 videos
00:26:29.440 so
00:26:29.960 I
00:26:30.080 will
00:26:30.919 take
00:26:31.120 a
00:26:31.279 rain
00:26:31.520 check
00:26:31.760 to
00:26:31.960 discuss
00:26:32.320 it
00:26:32.600 at
00:26:32.760 that
00:26:33.000 moment
00:26:33.399 and
00:26:33.600 revisit
00:26:34.159 if
00:26:34.279 you
00:26:34.480 like
00:26:34.799 the
00:26:34.960 generative
00:26:35.559 classification
00:26:36.559 framework
00:26:37.559 and
00:26:37.679 the
00:26:37.840 discussion
00:26:38.240 of
00:26:38.399 on
00:26:38.840 Bas
00:26:39.039 is
00:26:39.120 not
00:26:39.320 really
00:26:39.520 essential
00:26:39.960 right
00:26:40.120 now
00:26:40.279 for
00:26:40.440 us
00:26:40.559 to
00:26:40.799 progress
