00:00:00.719 in
00:00:00.919 this
00:00:01.120 video
00:00:01.880 I
00:00:01.959 would
00:00:02.159 like
00:00:02.320 to
00:00:02.480 start
00:00:02.760 the
00:00:03.000 discussion
00:00:03.560 about
00:00:03.959 convolutional
00:00:04.600 new
00:00:04.880 networks
00:00:05.319 which
00:00:05.400 is
00:00:05.600 another
00:00:06.399 architecture
00:00:07.399 of
00:00:08.000 neural
00:00:08.280 networks
00:00:08.679 that
00:00:08.880 we
00:00:09.400 are
00:00:09.639 going
00:00:09.840 to
00:00:10.000 see
00:00:10.400 specifically
00:00:10.960 kind
00:00:11.160 of
00:00:11.799 engineered
00:00:12.960 to
00:00:14.200 address
00:00:14.879 problems
00:00:15.360 that
00:00:15.559 we
00:00:15.679 are
00:00:15.879 facing
00:00:16.240 in
00:00:16.440 computer
00:00:16.840 vision
00:00:17.160 I
00:00:17.240 want
00:00:17.400 to
00:00:17.520 start
00:00:17.880 this
00:00:18.359 discussion
00:00:19.359 with
00:00:20.119 just
00:00:20.279 showing
00:00:20.600 you
00:00:20.760 a
00:00:21.240 picture
00:00:22.240 and
00:00:23.039 if
00:00:23.199 I
00:00:23.400 ask
00:00:23.680 you
00:00:24.760 to
00:00:24.920 tell
00:00:25.160 me
00:00:25.439 what
00:00:25.640 would
00:00:25.920 actually
00:00:26.240 be
00:00:26.480 the
00:00:26.720 first
00:00:27.240 object
00:00:27.640 that
00:00:27.720 you
00:00:27.920 pay
00:00:28.119 attention
00:00:28.560 to
00:00:29.560 then
00:00:30.119 most
00:00:30.439 people
00:00:30.720 will
00:00:31.000 probably
00:00:31.400 respond
00:00:31.920 to
00:00:32.680 with
00:00:33.160 yellow
00:00:33.559 cab
00:00:34.120 and
00:00:34.239 it's
00:00:34.440 not
00:00:34.640 really
00:00:34.920 accident
00:00:35.360 that
00:00:36.079 lot
00:00:36.280 of
00:00:36.520 cabs
00:00:37.239 in
00:00:38.239 a
00:00:38.320 lot
00:00:38.480 of
00:00:38.640 capitals
00:00:39.200 are
00:00:40.200 painted
00:00:41.520 yellow
00:00:42.520 U
00:00:42.680 and
00:00:42.879 of
00:00:43.000 course
00:00:43.280 that
00:00:44.039 attention
00:00:45.160 to
00:00:45.399 bright
00:00:45.760 colors
00:00:46.440 originates
00:00:47.199 from
00:00:48.199 thousands
00:00:48.600 of
00:00:48.760 years
00:00:48.960 of
00:00:49.199 evolution
00:00:49.800 where
00:00:50.039 people
00:00:51.039 are
00:00:51.559 of
00:00:51.719 course
00:00:52.320 trained
00:00:52.840 to
00:00:53.280 pay
00:00:53.520 attention
00:00:53.960 to
00:00:54.800 bright
00:00:55.160 colors
00:00:55.680 which
00:00:55.800 are
00:00:56.120 typically
00:00:57.000 sources
00:00:57.399 of
00:00:57.600 food
00:00:57.879 such
00:00:58.079 as
00:00:58.559 fruits
00:00:59.559 or
00:01:00.000 in
00:01:00.120 some
00:01:00.320 instances
00:01:01.239 sources
00:01:01.800 of
00:01:02.519 danger
00:01:03.199 such
00:01:03.440 as
00:01:04.239 the
00:01:04.439 yellow
00:01:05.439 tiger
00:01:05.960 that
00:01:06.119 is
00:01:06.280 coming
00:01:06.600 towards
00:01:07.320 us
00:01:08.439 so
00:01:09.439 kind
00:01:09.560 of
00:01:09.720 joking
00:01:10.200 aside
00:01:10.600 I
00:01:10.720 think
00:01:11.000 you
00:01:11.240 can
00:01:13.280 associate
00:01:14.520 this
00:01:15.000 kind
00:01:15.159 of
00:01:15.400 image
00:01:15.960 with
00:01:16.360 the
00:01:16.479 following
00:01:16.880 kind
00:01:17.000 of
00:01:17.320 processing
00:01:18.320 of
00:01:19.680 various
00:01:20.079 kind
00:01:20.200 of
00:01:20.320 stage
00:01:20.720 processing
00:01:21.360 that
00:01:22.000 is
00:01:22.159 been
00:01:22.400 going
00:01:22.640 on
00:01:22.799 in
00:01:22.920 your
00:01:23.320 brain
00:01:24.600 trying
00:01:24.920 to
00:01:25.520 from
00:01:25.720 the
00:01:25.960 kind
00:01:26.119 of
00:01:26.320 perception
00:01:26.799 system
00:01:27.119 that
00:01:27.520 embeds
00:01:28.640 into
00:01:28.920 it
00:01:29.240 that
00:01:29.360 we
00:01:29.479 have
00:01:29.600 embedded
00:01:30.119 into
00:01:30.320 it
00:01:30.520 so
00:01:30.840 if
00:01:30.960 you
00:01:31.079 can
00:01:31.320 imagine
00:01:31.799 the
00:01:32.439 process
00:01:33.759 then
00:01:33.960 the
00:01:34.159 first
00:01:34.439 thing
00:01:34.640 that
00:01:34.799 you
00:01:35.159 open
00:01:35.439 your
00:01:35.680 eyes
00:01:36.159 soon
00:01:36.280 that
00:01:36.439 you
00:01:36.520 have
00:01:36.680 your
00:01:36.840 eyes
00:01:37.119 closed
00:01:38.040 and
00:01:38.159 you
00:01:38.320 see
00:01:38.600 an
00:01:38.799 image
00:01:39.159 like
00:01:39.799 this
00:01:40.960 then
00:01:41.159 the
00:01:41.280 brain
00:01:41.600 is
00:01:41.799 actually
00:01:42.759 in
00:01:42.920 a
00:01:43.799 first
00:01:44.119 few
00:01:44.439 milliseconds
00:01:45.240 is
00:01:46.159 sampling
00:01:46.719 this
00:01:46.960 image
00:01:47.280 in
00:01:47.399 a
00:01:47.560 course
00:01:48.000 kind
00:01:48.159 of
00:01:48.560 way
00:01:49.840 and
00:01:50.399 determines
00:01:51.159 whether
00:01:51.719 we
00:01:52.000 have
00:01:53.159 situations
00:01:53.719 as
00:01:54.079 an
00:01:54.240 immediate
00:01:54.719 kind
00:01:54.880 of
00:01:55.040 threat
00:01:55.520 or
00:01:55.680 a
00:01:55.840 source
00:01:56.119 of
00:01:56.280 food
00:01:57.280 and
00:01:57.439 then
00:01:57.840 very
00:01:58.159 quickly
00:01:58.640 the
00:01:58.799 brain
00:01:59.159 switches
00:02:00.399 softly
00:02:01.640 into
00:02:02.920 objects
00:02:03.399 paying
00:02:03.680 attention
00:02:04.039 to
00:02:04.360 objects
00:02:04.799 which
00:02:04.920 are
00:02:05.200 associated
00:02:05.759 with
00:02:05.920 the
00:02:06.119 task
00:02:07.039 that
00:02:07.240 we
00:02:07.439 have
00:02:08.800 we
00:02:09.560 have
00:02:10.000 to
00:02:10.319 execute
00:02:11.160 so
00:02:11.360 we
00:02:11.520 have
00:02:11.760 the
00:02:12.120 for
00:02:12.280 example
00:02:12.560 if
00:02:12.640 you're
00:02:12.840 waiting
00:02:13.120 for
00:02:13.800 someone
00:02:14.959 in
00:02:15.160 this
00:02:15.400 kind
00:02:15.599 of
00:02:15.720 a
00:02:15.879 scene
00:02:16.480 then
00:02:16.640 you
00:02:16.840 start
00:02:17.160 paying
00:02:17.680 more
00:02:17.920 attention
00:02:18.280 to
00:02:18.519 people
00:02:18.800 coming
00:02:19.120 towards
00:02:19.560 you
00:02:19.800 people
00:02:20.080 getting
00:02:20.400 out
00:02:20.680 of
00:02:21.480 vehicles
00:02:22.000 and
00:02:23.360 on
00:02:24.360 so
00:02:24.680 now
00:02:25.440 what
00:02:25.640 I
00:02:26.040 like
00:02:26.280 to
00:02:26.879 start
00:02:27.280 getting
00:02:27.680 into
00:02:28.200 is
00:02:28.800 the
00:02:28.959 mechanics
00:02:29.480 of
00:02:29.959 a
00:02:30.080 little
00:02:30.280 bit
00:02:30.440 of
00:02:30.640 computer
00:02:31.080 vision
00:02:31.440 some
00:02:31.680 kind
00:02:31.800 of
00:02:32.000 basic
00:02:32.519 principles
00:02:33.519 and
00:02:33.680 I
00:02:33.760 wanted
00:02:34.080 to
00:02:34.400 cover
00:02:34.879 a
00:02:35.000 little
00:02:35.280 bit
00:02:36.200 you
00:02:36.319 know
00:02:36.560 the
00:02:37.000 question
00:02:37.519 as
00:02:37.680 to
00:02:38.080 okay
00:02:38.360 what
00:02:38.760 is
00:02:39.000 an
00:02:39.239 image
00:02:39.920 that
00:02:40.200 like
00:02:40.400 the
00:02:40.519 one
00:02:40.720 that
00:02:40.840 we've
00:02:41.040 seen
00:02:41.440 earlier
00:02:42.440 and
00:02:42.800 how
00:02:42.959 we're
00:02:43.159 going
00:02:43.280 to
00:02:43.519 represent
00:02:44.000 it
00:02:44.640 and
00:02:45.000 evidently
00:02:45.519 an
00:02:45.680 image
00:02:46.000 is
00:02:46.120 a
00:02:46.480 matrix
00:02:47.480 and
00:02:47.800 I
00:02:47.879 think
00:02:48.040 we
00:02:48.200 had
00:02:48.360 some
00:02:48.599 discussion
00:02:49.080 about
00:02:49.360 images
00:02:50.360 before
00:02:51.000 and
00:02:51.319 a
00:02:51.480 black
00:02:52.360 white
00:02:52.599 imag
00:02:52.920 is
00:02:53.480 or
00:02:53.640 a
00:02:53.800 grayscale
00:02:54.319 image
00:02:54.560 as
00:02:54.680 you
00:02:54.840 actually
00:02:55.080 see
00:02:55.480 over
00:02:55.800 here
00:02:56.280 is
00:02:57.800 a
00:02:57.959 matrix
00:02:58.720 of
00:02:59.560 that
00:03:00.879 elements
00:03:01.879 are
00:03:02.280 integer
00:03:03.040 numbers
00:03:04.040 and
00:03:05.000 this
00:03:05.280 integer
00:03:05.760 numbers
00:03:06.120 typically
00:03:06.720 we
00:03:06.879 are
00:03:07.959 you
00:03:08.040 know
00:03:08.200 each
00:03:08.440 element
00:03:08.879 corresponds
00:03:09.319 to
00:03:09.440 a
00:03:09.599 pixel
00:03:10.440 and
00:03:10.599 the
00:03:10.760 dynamic
00:03:11.200 range
00:03:11.760 that
00:03:11.920 we
00:03:12.159 associate
00:03:12.879 with
00:03:13.879 typically
00:03:14.319 for
00:03:14.440 in
00:03:14.599 computer
00:03:15.040 vision
00:03:15.959 with
00:03:16.120 those
00:03:16.400 pixels
00:03:16.799 are
00:03:16.959 8
00:03:17.280 Bits
00:03:17.920 so
00:03:18.239 we
00:03:18.480 represent
00:03:18.959 the
00:03:19.120 information
00:03:19.560 at
00:03:19.760 each
00:03:20.000 pixel
00:03:20.440 and
00:03:20.760 codes
00:03:21.120 as
00:03:21.319 8
00:03:21.640 Bits
00:03:22.400 which
00:03:22.560 means
00:03:22.760 that
00:03:22.959 these
00:03:23.120 integer
00:03:23.519 numbers
00:03:23.920 are
00:03:24.159 zero
00:03:24.560 from
00:03:24.720 0
00:03:25.000 to
00:03:25.760 255
00:03:26.760 and
00:03:27.360 so
00:03:28.560 when
00:03:28.720 we
00:03:28.879 go
00:03:29.040 to
00:03:29.239 color
00:03:29.519 IM
00:03:30.120 es
00:03:31.120 we
00:03:31.280 need
00:03:32.200 more
00:03:32.760 than
00:03:33.200 one
00:03:33.959 of
00:03:34.200 those
00:03:34.480 matrices
00:03:35.040 in
00:03:35.200 fact
00:03:35.400 we
00:03:35.519 need
00:03:35.799 three
00:03:36.120 matrices
00:03:36.680 typically
00:03:37.159 again
00:03:37.920 there
00:03:38.040 are
00:03:38.239 sensors
00:03:38.760 which
00:03:38.879 are
00:03:39.599 of
00:03:39.760 course
00:03:40.000 encode
00:03:40.480 the
00:03:40.680 information
00:03:41.120 to
00:03:41.439 far
00:03:41.680 more
00:03:42.000 than
00:03:42.920 three
00:03:43.200 matrices
00:03:44.159 but
00:03:44.360 those
00:03:44.560 three
00:03:44.760 matrices
00:03:45.319 are
00:03:45.920 corresponds
00:03:46.519 to
00:03:46.720 the
00:03:46.920 fundamental
00:03:47.799 colors
00:03:48.799 typically
00:03:49.200 of
00:03:49.439 red
00:03:49.760 green
00:03:50.120 and
00:03:50.560 blue
00:03:51.760 and
00:03:52.079 this
00:03:53.400 which
00:03:53.519 is
00:03:53.680 actually
00:03:54.120 what
00:03:54.239 you
00:03:54.400 see
00:03:54.720 here
00:03:55.480 and
00:03:55.680 also
00:03:56.000 probably
00:03:56.319 you
00:03:56.480 notice
00:03:56.840 that
00:03:57.000 these
00:03:57.200 numbers
00:03:57.480 are
00:03:57.680 now
00:03:57.840 floating
00:03:58.280 Point
00:03:58.560 numbers
00:03:58.959 let's
00:03:59.120 say
00:03:59.280 from
00:03:59.400 0
00:03:59.879 to
00:04:00.040 one
00:04:00.799 and
00:04:01.040 this
00:04:01.519 results
00:04:02.000 from
00:04:02.319 normalizing
00:04:03.200 these
00:04:04.400 pixel
00:04:04.799 numbers
00:04:06.200 to
00:04:07.040 with
00:04:07.159 a
00:04:07.280 number
00:04:07.920 255
00:04:08.920 because
00:04:09.200 2
00:04:09.400 to
00:04:09.519 the
00:04:09.640 power
00:04:09.879 of
00:04:10.000 8
00:04:10.400 is
00:04:11.360 256
00:04:12.360 and
00:04:13.480 therefore
00:04:13.959 all
00:04:14.159 our
00:04:14.480 numbers
00:04:14.840 will
00:04:15.000 be
00:04:15.200 from
00:04:15.360 0
00:04:15.680 to
00:04:15.840 255
00:04:16.600 in
00:04:16.840 those
00:04:17.079 matrices
00:04:18.000 if
00:04:18.120 we
00:04:18.280 start
00:04:18.600 dividing
00:04:19.120 every
00:04:19.400 element
00:04:19.759 with
00:04:20.120 255
00:04:21.120 we
00:04:21.320 get
00:04:21.639 numbers
00:04:22.120 between
00:04:22.479 0
00:04:22.840 and
00:04:23.280 1
00:04:24.280 and
00:04:24.440 this
00:04:24.560 is
00:04:24.919 basically
00:04:25.360 what
00:04:25.479 we
00:04:25.600 need
00:04:25.759 to
00:04:25.919 do
00:04:26.400 in
00:04:26.520 order
00:04:26.800 to
00:04:27.199 process
00:04:28.360 the
00:04:28.600 images
00:04:29.280 in
00:04:29.520 with
00:04:30.000 our
00:04:30.440 new
00:04:30.680 neural
00:04:31.039 networks
00:04:31.440 that
00:04:31.600 we
00:04:31.720 will
00:04:31.919 introduce
00:04:32.479 now
00:04:32.759 called
00:04:33.120 the
00:04:33.280 convolutional
00:04:33.880 neural
00:04:34.440 networks
00:04:35.440 so
00:04:36.120 with
00:04:36.360 convolutional
00:04:36.919 neural
00:04:37.240 networks
00:04:38.199 we
00:04:38.639 need
00:04:38.919 to
00:04:39.160 start
00:04:39.639 the
00:04:39.880 discussion
00:04:40.840 on
00:04:41.400 what
00:04:41.560 is
00:04:41.680 a
00:04:42.039 convolution
00:04:43.039 and
00:04:43.520 this
00:04:43.639 is
00:04:43.840 what's
00:04:44.039 coming
