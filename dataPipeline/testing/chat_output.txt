00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.399 | Introduction to CNNs | in this video I would like to start the discussion about convolutional new networks which is another architecture of neural networks that we are going to see
00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:17.240 | CNNs in Computer Vision | specifically kind of engineered to address problems that we are facing in computer vision I want to start this discussion with just showing you a picture
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:29.560 | Attention to Objects | if I ask you to tell me what would actually be the first object that you pay attention to then most people will probably respond to yellow cab and it's not really accident that a lot of cabs in capitals are painted yellow
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:42.680 | Evolutionary Perspective on Attention | and that attention to bright colors originates from thousands of years of evolution where people are trained to pay attention to bright colors which are typically sources of food such as fruits or danger like the yellow tiger coming towards us
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:55.160 | Visual Processing in the Brain | so joking aside I think you can imagine this kind of processing in your brain when you first open your eyes and start sampling an image in your mind and then determine if itâ€™s a threat or food
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:09.120 | Shifting Attention in Response | then quickly shifting attention to tasks that you need to execute in response like paying attention to people coming towards you or getting out of vehicles
00:00:09.120 --> 00:01:22.000 | Introduction to Computer Vision | and then the processing of visual images is where we get into computer vision the mechanics of computer vision including image representation and matrix forms
00:00:22.000 --> 00:01:40.640 | Image Data Representation | how we represent image data in our brain with integer numbers corresponding to pixels and using 8-bit encoding for image pixels to store information on image brightness that we associate with visual tasks and dynamic range for computer vision applications
